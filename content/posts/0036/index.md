I have been taking classes at [Foothill College](https://foothill.edu) for nearly four years, but today was the first day that I took a class in-person.

I never realized what I was missing. The campus is much nicer than I expected from a community college. It has a nice, woody aesthetic, which is interesting given it's location in the heart of the concrete-and-glass jungle of Silicon Valley. Of course, it can't compete with a university like Stanford, but it almost holds up against Santa Clara University, a school I particularly liked.

The class I'm taking is Chemistry 1A, the second Chemistry class the school offers. I am taking it two days a week, which means that the lab and lecture are on the same day. My lab is 3 hours straight at 9 in the morning, and it's definitely tiring.

The teacher is fine, but nothing special. I'm looking forward to my first lab next week. I'm not too hot on the timings, and don't know if I will continue the course. I probably will, but who knows?
