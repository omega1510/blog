> Sorrow is concealed in gilded palaces, and thereâ€™s no escaping it.

Last night I finished reading _The Double: A Petersburg Poem_. It is the third of Dostoevsky's works that I have read. I am usually a huge fan of the author; my favorite book is _Crime and Punishment_ and I also loved _Notes from the Underground_. I love the deep explorations of morality and psychology that are woven throughout his books. His dialogue is unlike anything else that I have read: it is so real, personal, and engaging.

_The Double_ was an impulse buy from the bookstore on Stanford's campus. I was looking for a copy of _The Idiot_ or _The Brothers Karamazov_, but _The Double_ caught my eye instead. The description on the back piqued my interest even further. I bought the book, thinking that I was in for an enjoyable and thought-provoking read.

Boy, was I wrong. _The Double_ was nothing like _Crime_ or _Notes_. In my opinion, this is one of Dostoevsky's weaker works and was not very enjoyable to read. I found the plot drawn out and repetitive, and the prose difficult to read. I would normally attribute the latter gripe to the translator, but I have read elswhere that the original Russian text of the book was just as complicated.

The dialogue and psychological exploration was still outstanding, marking the novel as distinctly Dostoevskian. Similar to his other novels, it features an blood-curdling ability to force you into the protagonist's head. I felt like I was inside his thoughts, following him hand-in-hand in his psychological descent. 

However, this forte was held back by a plot I could not fully understand. It closely followed the protagonist's actions, but when your protagonist is an anxious schizophrenic, the story becomes incredibly confusing.

In the end, I agree with Dostoevsky's own opinion of the work. He stated in _[A Writer's Diary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Writer%27s_Diary)_:
> Most decidedly, I did not succeed with that novel; however, its idea was rather lucid, and I have never expressed in my writings anything more serious. Still, as far as form was concerned, I failed utterly.
