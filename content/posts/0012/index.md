I don't have any social media. I never have. But every day I am swarmed with signals from the top platforms on the web to JOIN JOIN JOIN! And when the signals aren't directly from them, they are from friends and family, who subtly give me funny looks when I tell them that I don't have an Instagram.

Yesterday, I nearly made a Mastodon account. _Nearly._ While Mastodon is great as far as social media platforms go, it is still fundamentaly a breed of app I don't want anything to do with.

Big social media platforms have gone from cities upon a hill to something that resembles today's San Francisco: dirty, crime-ridden, and dying. I think I'll stick to my house in the forest, even if nobody is here with me.
