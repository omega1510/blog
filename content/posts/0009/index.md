> It is He who made the night a garment for you, and sleep a rest, and made the day like a resurrection. (Quran 25:47)

School has started up again this week. On the second day of English class, the teacher showed [this Ted Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MuIMqhT8DM) about sleep to us. The video discussed the numerous consequenses of not getting a good night's sleep. The ones that stood out most to me were:

- Lowered intelligence by 40%
- Inability to commit events to long-term memory
- Increase in rates of car accidents and heart attacks
- Promotion of cancer and harm to the immune system

I really need to start focusing on my sleep. My nighttime routine involves washing up, praying, and reading a book before slowly drifting to sleep. Some nights, I don't fall asleep until 1am. I will just lie there with my eyes open for an hour and half, blink, and wake up five hours later.

The most simple improvement is just going to bed earlier. Reading action-packed novels can keep my mind awake long after I put the book down, so avoiding these types of books when I am winding down is also key.

Here is the video. I encourage everyone to watch it.
