## Motivation

I think it's fitting for the first post on this blog to be an explanation of why I'm writing.

One of my friends recently began posting more of his thoughts on social media because he felt that writing had taken a backseat in his life. He wanted to rekindle that quickly fading love for the pen. I don't think that's the case with me.

Neither do I want to attract followers or make money. If I wanted to do that, I would be posting AI-generated content somewhere with more eyes, like Medium.

I discovered a quote that I think sums up my thoughts nicely. Amit G. [writes](https://amitg.blog/my-daughter-was-writing-in-her-journal-today-and-casually-asked-me-why-she-does):

> My daughter went on to scribble happily in her journal. Once she was done, she said, “I love how I feel when I capture everything on my mind in these pages.”
> 
> Even I want that now.

I want to write because there is something trapped inside of me angry that I won't let it out. There are way to many thoughts in my head, fighting to be put down on paper. I want this blog to be a place where I can let the little [bluebird](https://allpoetry.com/poem/8509539-Bluebird-by-Charles-Bukowski) in my soul roam free, at least for a little while.

## Future Plans

This blog will have absolutely no AI-generated content. It will have no advertisements, tracking, or harvesting of data. It will be raw and free: a place where I can write down my thoughts for the world to see.

I recently came across [Julia Cameron's Morning Pages](https://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/), where you write three pages from the heart stream-of-conciousness style every morning. That's a little too hardcore for me.

I'm aiming for posting about 300 words every day on this blog. Some days I'll write more, some days less. It's all about building a habit. Let's see how it goes.

**Update:** I have enabled completely anonymized tracking. Nothing personally identifiable, even your IP address, is collected.
