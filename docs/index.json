[{"content":"This question was first asked to me nearly a decade ago by an elementary school teacher. It has stuck with me all these years because, as far as I can tell, it was my first introduction to the world of philosophy. When the teacher asked it to that group of young third-graders, no one could answer him. Now, I think I might have a response.\nWhat is an Evil Action?  An evil intention perverts the best actions, and makes them sins.\n— Joseph Addison\n To clear up any ambiguity, we need to determine what exactly makes an action evil. We may define it very broadly, such that an evil action is one where there is even a small amount of immorality present, regardless of the greater good. This would include the classical \u0026ldquo;bad\u0026rdquo; actions, like murder and lying, as well as immoral acts performed for a large benefit, as in the case of the trolley problem. Nearly every action we perform could be considered evil under this definition. An action performed solely for our benefit could be considered selfish, and therefore evil, for example.\nInstead, one may limit the broad definition of evil, stating that an evil action is any action where the bad in it outweighs the good. This definition necessarily encompasses all immoral acts while omitting ones performed for the greater good.\nA second alternative is a strict definition, where an action must be completely morally wrong, without any shred of good, for it to be considered evil. With this view, we omit many actions that are technically wrong but that nobody would call \u0026ldquo;evil,\u0026rdquo; such as white lies, for even a white lie would be beneficial to someone. However, we also exclude nearly every immoral act because most of them contain at least a little good; they are, so to speak, for the lesser good, but still good nonetheless.\nI find the second definition—the limited yet broad one—to be the most appealing. It leaves wiggle room for actions performed for the greater good but includes things we would normally consider evil, like homicide.\nWhat is an Evil Person?  To prefer evil to good is not in human nature; and when a man is compelled to choose one of two evils, no one will choose the greater when he might have the less.\n— Plato\n An evil person could be someone who simply performs bad actions, no matter how little. If we accept this definition, in combination with either broad definition of evil, to be evil is to be human because men are not angels: we always incline towards a little bit of sin as consequence of our free will.1\nIf we consider an evil person as someone who performs only evil and no good, we get nowhere. Even Hitler, who we can all agree is evil, still paid his officers' wages. He did not wake up every morning with just the intention to kill. If we take this approach, no one in the history of mankind has been evil.\nIn my opinion, the best definition of an evil person, as with the case of evil actions, is someone who performs more evil than they do good. With this definition and the medium definition of evil, all the classical \u0026ldquo;evil\u0026rdquo; figures—Stalin, Hitler, Mao—would all be considered evil.\nThe answer to the question \u0026ldquo;Do evil people exist?\u0026rdquo; depends on your definition of \u0026ldquo;evil\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;evil person.\u0026rdquo; It can be argued that everybody is evil, or nobody is evil, or that only a few bad figures are evil. It is a matter of nuance and personal preference, and there is no right answer.\n  Even if you don\u0026rsquo;t believe in free will, I think you can agree that no one acts morally all of the time, regardless of whether they are responsible for their actions.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","permalink":"https://omega1510.github.io/blog/posts/0005/do-evil-people-exist/","summary":"This question was first asked to me nearly a decade ago by an elementary school teacher.

I am very interested in seeing how this precedent plays out in court cases in the coming years.\nIn particular, the issue of how much editing a human needs to do to the generated content for it to be considered a derivative work is of paramount importance and interest. If you have ChatGPT write an article, but you make a website and post it online, is that enough \u0026ldquo;modification\u0026rdquo; for you to be given ownership over the work?1 What if you perform minimal edits, like removing the [YOUR NAME] bits the AI sometimes outputs? Is that \u0026ldquo;modification?\u0026rdquo; SAG-AFTRA, the Hollywood writers union that is currently on strike over the use of AI in the industry, has a vested interest in not allowing copyrighting of works where even a little bit of generative AI was used.\nAI is meant to be used like an assistant. So if you and your assistant work on something together, and your assistant releases it to the public domain, how much editing to you need to do for you to claw back ownership and copyright it?\nI am going to be closely following developments in the realm of artificial intelligence and copyright; I find this field, filled with moral landmines and massive grey areas, to be fascinating.\n  By the way, absolutely no generative AI is used when writing for this blog. In fact, I barely use generative AI at all because I find its use to be morally questionable and intellectually debillitating.

It is the third of Dostoevsky\u0026rsquo;s works that I have read. I am usually a huge fan of the author; my favorite book is Crime and Punishment and I also loved Notes from the Underground. I love the deep explorations of morality and psychology that are woven throughout his books. His dialogue is unlike anything else that I have read: it is so real, personal, and engaging.\nThe Double was an impulse buy from the bookstore on Stanford\u0026rsquo;s campus. I was looking for a copy of The Idiot or The Brothers Karamazov, but The Double caught my eye instead. The description on the back piqued my interest even further. I bought the book, thinking that I was in for an enjoyable and thought-provoking read.\nBoy, was I wrong. The Double was nothing like Crime or Notes. In my opinion, this is one of Dostoevsky\u0026rsquo;s weaker works and was not very enjoyable to read. I found the plot drawn out and repetitive, and the prose difficult to read. I would normally attribute the latter gripe to the translator, but I have read elswhere that the original Russian text of the book was just as complicated.\nThe dialogue and psychological exploration was still outstanding, marking the novel as distinctly Dostoevskian. Similar to his other novels, it features an blood-curdling ability to force you into the protagonist\u0026rsquo;s head. I felt like I was inside his thoughts, following him hand-in-hand in his psychological descent.\nHowever, this forte was held back by a plot I could not fully understand. It closely followed the protagonist\u0026rsquo;s actions, but when your protagonist is an anxious schizophrenic, the story becomes incredibly confusing.\nIn the end, I agree with Dostoevsky\u0026rsquo;s own opinion of the work. He stated in A Writer\u0026rsquo;s Diary:\n Most decidedly, I did not succeed with that novel; however, its idea was rather lucid, and I have never expressed in my writings anything more serious. Still, as far as form was concerned, I failed utterly.\n ","permalink":"https://omega1510.github.io/blog/posts/0003/the-double/","summary":"Sorrow is concealed in gilded palaces, and there’s no escaping it.\n Last night I finished reading The Double: A Petersburg Poem.

Now that I think about it, I probably read too much. I stay up for hours most nights engrossed in the expansive world behind my Kindle\u0026rsquo;s screen, dying to learn about the latest adventure the protagonist has gotten caught up in.\nWhen introducing myself to someone new, I usually say that I read books as a hobby. Recently, a girl I was talking to asked me my favorite book. \u0026ldquo;Crime and Punishment,\u0026rdquo; I responded. She replied, \u0026ldquo;Dostoevsky, right?\u0026rdquo; I can\u0026rsquo;t convey on paper how much joy I felt in that moment.\nI realized that my life was missing someone I could really talk to about what I\u0026rsquo;m reading. Unfortunately, I\u0026rsquo;m the only male I know who loves fiction in this way. Some of my friends will gladly read the latest self-help book or thousand-page physics tome, but none of them can get lost in the pages of a good novel.\nI wish I had a friend group with whom I could discuss the literature I find myself consumed by. Some people to talk to about the things on my mind. I believe that many men are in a similar situation to myself.\nSo my question is, when did reading fiction become a woman\u0026rsquo;s thing to do? The statistics are clear: Goodreads reported in 2014 that women read two times more books published that year than their male counterparts.\nWhat is the cause? According to a study published in 2000, girls are more likely to be encouraged by their parents to read at a young age and usually have more free-time to do so later in life.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a shame that a hobby like reading, widely considered to provide social, intellectual, and personal benefits, must be a gendered activity.
