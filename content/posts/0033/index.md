> And now I know not what virtue is, and you seem to be in the same case, although you did once perhaps know.

Thus spoke Socrates in Plato's [_Meno_](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1643/pg1643-images.html#:~:text=and%20now%20i%20know%20not%20what%20virtue%20is%2C%20and%20you%20seem%20to%20be%20in%20the%20same%20case%2C%20although%20you%20did%20once%20perhaps%20know). In my opinon, one of the great tradegies of the modern era is that so many of us have lost our way. We all fall short, in one way or another, in our life-long pursuit of virtue.

The problem has its foundation in the definition of virtue. For those of us that believe in a soul, Socrates among them, the definition is relatively easy to achieve. Our souls were in contact before our births with the True, the Good, and the Beautiful; defining virtue is simply remembering what we have once forgotten, hence Socrates' statement above.

But for those who deny the existence of the soul, or, in fact, any greater reality above the human experience, this approach is unapplicable. For someone like Kant, who argues that we cannot know the world as it is, we must define virtue _subjectively_, within the frameworks through which we experience reality.

A possible solution involves inductive reasoning, where you derive a general rule from the observation of many smaller incidents. Perhaps it is possible to define virtue by observing virtuous actions, and attempt to discover a general rule therein. However, while this form of reasoning is ubiquitous in scientific research, it does not apply here.

Plato addresses this approach early in his dialogue, [Meno](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1643/pg1643-images.html#:~:text=SOCRATES%3A%20Then%20as,Compare%20Arist.%20Pol.):

> **Socrates:**\
> …By the gods, Meno, be generous, and tell me what you say that virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find that I have been mistaken, and that you… do really have this knowledge; although I have been just saying that I have never found anybody who had.
> 
> **Meno:**\
> There will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering your question. Let us take first the virtue of a man—he should know how to administer the state, and in the administration of it to benefit his friends and harm his enemies; and he must also be careful not to suffer harm himself. A woman's virtue, if you wish to know about that, may also be easily described: her duty is to order her house, and keep what is indoors, and obey her husband. Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of each of us in all that we do. And the same may be said of vice, Socrates.

Ahh, the classic argument for subjective morality. Socrates makes no delay in swiftly pointing out its flaws, however:

> **Socrates:**\
> When you say, Meno, that there is one virtue of a man, another of a woman, another of a child, and so on, does this apply only to virtue, or would you say the same of health, and size, and strength? Or is the nature of health always the same, whether in man or woman?
> 
> **Meno:**\
> I should say that health is the same, both in man and woman.
> 
> **Socrates:**\
> And is not this true of size and strength? If a woman is strong, she will be strong by reason of the same form and of the same strength subsisting in her which there is in the man. I mean to say that strength, as strength, whether of man or woman, is the same. Is there any difference?
> 
> **Meno:**\
> I think not.
> 
> **Socrates:**\
> And will not virtue, as virtue, be the same, whether in a child or in a grown-up person, in a woman or in a man?

In other words, Socrates agrees that leading a state or maintaining a household are virtuous actions, but simply stating that they are does not constitute a definition of virtue. Instead, these actions all share a certain characteristic—that of true virtue—among other characteristics that differentiate them. To identify virtue by looking at virtuous actions, Socrates argues, we must identify a characteristic common to all virtuous actions, and not just give examples of the latter.

It is in this endeavor that difficulty lies. It is akin to me giving you an apple, an orange, and a peach, and asking you to give me an objective definition of what a fruit is. Incredibly difficult, if not impossible. Similarly, in ethics, it is incredibly difficult to derive a definition of virtue by considering virtuous actions.

A "bottom-up" approach is not effective in the pursuit of virtue. While it does seem like a good idea, inductive reasoning falls short in practice. A "top-down" perspective is much simpler, and as [Occam's Razor](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Occams-razor) tells us, is much more likely to be correct.
