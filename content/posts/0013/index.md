> "But man is not made for defeat," he said. "A man can be destroyed but not defeated."

Thus states the old man in Ernest Hemingway's timeless novel, _The Old Man and the Sea._ I recently finished this book, which was one of the best novels I have read in the past few months. In it, Hemingway uses incredibly simple language to craft a beautiful plot of willpower and determination. The book features an old fisherman who goes out to sea further than he has ever gone, and ends up catching a fish weighing over a thousand pounds.

Through the book's protagonist, Hemingway symbolizes the peak of manhood: an unwavering—and sometimes detrimental—resolve to achieve a goal. Hemingway shows that it is not raw power or an aggressive personality that makes a man; rather, it is determination in the face of certain defeat that really matters. In other words, manliness is the ability to always rise from defeat.

I planned to list out some of the specific lessons and symbolism in _The Old Man and the Sea_. However, this article does it much better than I can: [Lessons in Manliness from The Old Man and the Sea](https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/manly-lessons/lessons-in-manliness-from-the-old-man-and-the-sea/). I highly recommend everyone read it after they have read Hemingway's original novel.

I think that it is to every man's advantage to read _The Old Man and the Sea_. It's a short novel, too; it comes in around 100 pages, and its simple language means anyone can easily benefit.
