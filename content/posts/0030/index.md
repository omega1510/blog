Fyodor Dostoevsky writes in [_The Brothers Karamzov_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brothers_Karamazov):

> Miracles are never a stumbling-block to the realist. It is not miracles that dispose realist to belief. The genuine realist, if he is an unbeliever, will always find strength and ability to disbelieve in the miraculous, and if he is confronted with a miracle as an irrefutable fact he would rather disbelieve his own senses than admit that fact. Even if he admits it, he admits it as a fact of nature till then unrecognized by him. Faith does not, in the realist, spring from the miracle but the miracle from faith. If the realist once believes, then he is bound by his very realism to admit the miraculous also. The Apostle Thomas said that he would not believe till he saw, but when he did see he said, "My Lord and my God!" Was it the miracle forced him to believe? Most likely not, but he believed solely because he desired to believe and possibly he fully believed in his secret heart even when he said, "I do not believe till I see."

I am particularly struck by the line: "â€¦if he is confronted with a miracle as an irrefutable fact he would rather disbelieve his own senses than admit that fact." I was recently debating someone of a different religious leaning and pointed out an inconsistency in his religious books. He then denied the very veracity of his accepted scripture, rather than admit I was right.

I'm sure we have all argued with people when we know we are right. Some people who just don't want to admit the truth will deny everything except for what is consistent with their beliefs. These same people debate not for gaining knowledge, but for the sake of argument. They just don't want to believe, and at that point, nothing can change them except for themselves. One cannot offer a glass of water to someone who denies the existence of thirst.
