> What's the bravest thing you ever did? He spat in the road a bloody phlegm. Getting up this morning, he said.

Yesterday I finished [_The Road_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road) by Cormac McCarthy. I usually don't read contemporary literature, but I stumbled on this book in a Reddit thread about emotional books, and decided to give it a shot. It was published in 2006, and I feel that it was a breath of fresh air given that I mostly read 19th-century Russian novels.

The book describes the journey of a father and son in a post-apocalyptic landscape decimated by an unspecified cataclysm. There are many themes in the book, but I would like to focus on reason vs. emotion in this post.

The father is far from optimistic. Numerous times throughout the plot, the son asks his father if there are other good people still alive somewhere, like Mars. The father makes no delay in shutting this optimism down, saying that it's impossible for humans to survive on other planets.

Instead, he is focused on survival in a completely rational way. He doesn't let emotion cloud his judgement. The boy falters in fear when entering an abandoned house, but the father goes in knowing they must find food or die.

However, the end reveals that it is a mix of rationality and emotion that helps you achieve salvation. The boy's life is saved after the father's death only because he emotionally trusted a random stranger. Similarly, the father and son have only survived this long because the father put logic first.

This shows that it is important to strike a balance in our life. Going full on Rousseau is not the right decision, nor is going full on Enlightenment. It is in the middle that we can best live our lives.
