The existence of God has been a point of contention among philosophers for as long as philosophy has existed. Even Socrates called into question the supremacy of the ancient Greek gods in his home of Athens nearly half a millenium prior to the birth of Christ. Still today, theists are engaged in vigorous debate with modern philosophers over rational evidence for God's existence.

In the mid-13th century, Catholic philosopher Thomas Aquinas composed his magnum opus, the [_Summa Theologica_](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/17611/pg17611.html), a religious textbook for students beginning their studies in theology. He recognized the necessity of proving God's existence in his work, and wrote the [Quinque Viae](https://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm#article3): five ways to argue that God does indeed exist.

Aquinas' arguments are admittedly weak when exposed to modern scrutiny, but they provide a basis for many modern arguments favoring God. They are heavily cited, "classic" theological arguments, not necessarily fool-proof ones. Nevertheless, they create an excellent baseline on which to form a complete understanding of God's existence.

## The Argument of the Unmoved Mover

In the world we live in, everything is in motion. But for something to be in motion, it must have been moved by something else. For example, if I push a block of wood, a chemical imbalance in my muscles acted a force on the block. The chemical imbalance also itself was caused by electrical impulses in my nerves, which in turn were caused by something else.

This chain cannot be infinitely long; it therefore follows that there must have been a first mover in the beginning who, while unmoved, exerted a force on the universe. This primeval entity is understood to be God.

## The Argument of the First Cause

We live in a world of cause and effect. Things are caused by other things. It is not possible for a thing to cause itself, so it must have been caused by another distinct event. This second event is itself the effect of another cause, and so on. For example, a plant grows because of sunlight, which exists because of the sun, which exists because of gravity.

Like in the first argument, this chain cannot continue ad infinitum. A first cause must exist that began the chain but was not caused itself. This cause is God.

## The Argument from Contingency

Things can be broadly divided into two groups: the possible and the necessary. Possible things are those that have the ability to not exist. For example, cats are possible entities because they live and die, and if you go back far enough in time, no cats existed.

For every possible thing, there is a time in the past when it did not exist. If everything is possible, then there must exist a time long in the past when nothing existed at all. If this is the case, then nothing could exist now, because nothing can come into existence except through a being that already exists.

Therefore, it follows that a necessary being—something that _must_ exist and cannot be nonexistent—existed in the beginning. Everything that exists draws its existence back to it. This necessary being is God.

## The Argument from Degree

All things vary in their imitation of the True, the Good, and the Beautiful. Some entities imitate at a higher degree, and are subsequently considered better. For example, in a room of people, there is always a tallest.

Something must exist that is the most True, Good, and Beautiful—the "tallest" of all existence, so to speak. Furthermore, the most perfect in any group is the cause of all qualities of that group, like how fire, the pinnacle of heat, is the cause of all hot things. There must be a being to which all truth, nobility, and beauty is devoted—a being perfect in every way. This being we call God.

## The Argument from Final Cause

Inanimate objects in the world behave in regular and predictable ways. If their design was based purely on chance, then their behavior would not be predictable. For these inanimate objects, which lack intelligence, the fact that they move toward the same purpose means they must have been directed by something else with intelligence and influence.

Therefore, a being must exist that is the source of all common purpose in the governance of the world. God is this being.

## Discussion

I find myself agreeing with much of what Aquinas has to say. His simple language and illustrative examples helped me refine the thoughts floating around my head. I am sure we have all heard the Argument of the Unmoved Mover and Argument from Final Cause before, but to read it from the source is an enlightening experience.

Modern philosophy has not failed to uncover fallacies in Aquinas' arguments; in addition, his writings leave a distinctly Platonic/Aristotelian aftertaste in my mouth. But there is something endearing about Aquinas' attempt at distilling things I have heard for years into concrete philosophical statements. There is undoubtedly a reason why Aquinas is so commonly referenced in philosophy courses: he took a concept as perfect as God and made it comprehensible by the imperfect human cognition.
