[{"content":"Motivation I think it\u0026rsquo;s fitting for the first post on this blog to be an explanation of why I\u0026rsquo;m writing.\nOne of my friends recently began posting more of his thoughts on social media because he felt that writing had taken a backseat in his life. He wanted to rekindle that quickly fading love for the pen. I don\u0026rsquo;t think that\u0026rsquo;s the case with me.\nNeither do I want to attract followers or make money. If I wanted to do that, I would be posting AI-generated content somewhere with more eyes, like Medium.\nI discovered a quote that I think sums up my thoughts nicely. Amit G. writes:\n My daughter went on to scribble happily in her journal. Once she was done, she said, “I love how I feel when I capture everything on my mind in these pages.”\nEven I want that now.\n I want to write because there is something trapped inside of me angry that I won\u0026rsquo;t let it out. There are way to many thoughts in my head, fighting to be put down on paper. I want this blog to be a place where I can let the little bluebird in my soul roam free, at least for a little while.\nFuture Plans This blog will have absolutely no AI-generated content. It will have no advertisements, tracking, or harvesting of data. It will be raw and free: a place where I can write down my thoughts for the world to see.\nI recently came across Julia Cameron\u0026rsquo;s Morning Pages, where you write three pages from the heart stream-of-conciousness style every morning. That\u0026rsquo;s a little too hardcore for me.\nI\u0026rsquo;m aiming for posting about 300 words every day on this blog. Some days I\u0026rsquo;ll write more, some days less. It\u0026rsquo;s all about building a habit. Let\u0026rsquo;s see how it goes.\n","permalink":"https://omega1510.github.io/blog/posts/hello-world/","summary":"Motivation I think it\u0026rsquo;s fitting for the first post on this blog to be an explanation of why I\u0026rsquo;m writing.\nOne of my friends recently began posting more of his thoughts on social media because he felt that writing had taken a backseat in his life.
