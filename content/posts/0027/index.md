I'm trying to watch less of what YouTube recommends, but it sometimes shows me an incredible piece of media. I got recommended this video today:

I'm sure you are familiar with the printer-ink pricing model. Sell the printer for cheap, sometimes even at a loss, and recoup all your money and more by selling ink at incredibly high prices in perpetuity. No one likes it, except for the companies selling the ink.

Danaher, a company that owns many biotech companies, loves this model. Their daughter company Cepheid makes an amazing and reasonably priced tuberculosis test machine that gives fast results without an expensive lab, which should make testing more accessible in low-income countries. Except for the fact that they mark up the actual tests by 300-500%, overcharging the people who can least afford it.

This is not okay. Over 40% of TB cases go undiagnosed, and Danaher could save hundreds of thousands of lives if they drop the price of tests down to \$5, a price that is low but still allows them to turn a profit. Right now, the tests are \$10-\$15, the same as the weekly median salary in TB-ridden Sierra Leone.

This is not okay. People who need these tests the most pay too often with their lives. Danaher, it's time for \$5.
