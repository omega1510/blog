> During his years in prisons and in camps he’d lost the habit of planning for the next day, for a year ahead, for supporting his family. The authorities did his thinking for him about everything—it was somehow easier that way.

I just finished reading [_One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_in_the_Life_of_Ivan_Denisovich), so it's time for me to have a good yell at the Soviet Union.

But first, some background about the book. It's author, [Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Solzhenitsyn), was imprisoned in the Soviet Union's harsh Gulag work camp system under Stalin from 1945 to 1953. After his release, Solzhenitsyn began writing _One Day_, a narrative of life in the Gulag. The book helped spark a wave of anti-Soviet sentiment after its publication.

I am almost struggling to give a consice overview of the Gulag's psychological horror outlined in this novel. It is so dense and multifaceted that no short post like this can do it justice. Whenever you think that Solzhenitsyn has covered all the atrocities of the labor camps, the book hits you with another way the Gulag tries to break its prisoners. Does the horror stop at physical work? No, there are no fixed wages and another person screwing up means no one gets any money. Does it stop there? No, corruption in the Gulag's administration means you can't file complaints either. Does it stop there? Absolutely not.

I am so upset that people were abused to the point that they must lick other people's bowls of soup clean to get enough nutrition. And camps like this aren't a relic of the past; they still exist in places like China and Burma.

The novel is still very much applicable to us in the current era. It continues to show us the depths of the human soul through the eyes of prisoners in the Gulag.
