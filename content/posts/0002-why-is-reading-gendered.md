I read a lot. Now that I think about it, I probably read too much. I stay up for hours most nights engrossed in the expansive world behind my Kindle's screen, dying to learn about the latest adventure the protagonist has gotten caught up in.

When introducing myself to someone new, I usually say that I read books as a hobby. Recently, a girl I was talking to asked me my favorite book. "_Crime and Punishment_," I responded. She replied, "Dostoevsky, right?" I can't convey on paper how much joy I felt in that moment. 

I realized that my life was missing someone I could really talk to about what I'm reading. Unfortunately, I'm the only male I know who loves fiction in this way. Some of my friends will gladly read the latest self-help book or thousand-page physics tome, but none of them can get lost in the pages of a good novel.

I wish I had a friend group with whom I could discuss the literature I find myself consumed by. Some people to talk to about the things on my mind. I believe that many men are in a similar situation to myself.

So my question is, when did reading fiction become a woman's thing to do? The statistics are clear: Goodreads [reported](https://www.goodreads.com/blog/show/475-sex-and-reading-a-look-at-who-s-reading-whom) in 2014 that women read two times more books published that year than their male counterparts.

What is the cause? According to [a study](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-422X(00)00003-6) published in 2000, girls are more likely to be encouraged by their parents to read at a young age and usually have more free-time to do so later in life.

It's a shame that a hobby like reading, widely considered to provide social, intellectual, and personal benefits, must be a gendered activity. To all the parents out there, encourage your sons to read!
