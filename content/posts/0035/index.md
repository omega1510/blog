Khalil Gibran writes in his book [_The Prophet_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prophet_(book)) on talking:

> You talk when you cease to be at peace with your thoughts;\
> And when you can no longer dwell in the solitude of your heart you live in your lips, and sound is a diversion and a pastime.\
> And in much of your talking, thinking is half murdered.\
> For thought is a bird of space, that in a cage of words may indeed unfold its wings but cannot fly.
> 
> There are those among you who seek the talkative through fear of being alone.\
> The silence of aloneness reveals to their eyes their naked selves and they would escape.\
> And there are those who talk, and without knowledge or forethought reveal a truth which they themselves do not understand.\
> And there are those who have the truth within them, but they tell it not in words.\
> In the bosom of such as these the spirit dwells in rhythmic silence.
> 
> When you meet your friend on the roadside or in the market place, let the spirit in you move your lips and direct your tongue.\
> Let the voice within your voice speak to the ear of his ear;\
> For his soul will keep the truth of your heart as the taste of the wine is remembered\
> When the colour is forgotten and the vessel is no more.

This passage highlights a very important idea when it comes to talking (or blogging). One can talk just to get away from his thoughts, or to spread them. These surface-level conversations (e.g. "How's the weather?") serve as nothing but distractions.

Instead, we can talk about deeper topics. I feel that, as a society, we have moved away from stimulating conversations. For example, an average conversation in a 19th century novel I'm reading is about the jurisdiction of ecclesiastical courts. That is not something that would be talked about today. In my opinion, we have lost something vital in this.

We have concentrated our focus in the second paragraph of the excerpt above. Those of us who talk don't think, and those of us who think don't talk. As with most things, perfection is found in balance.
