For centuries, philosophers have debated what free will is and whether we even possess it. In an increasingly scientific world, some of them argue that our choices are determined only by the laws of physics. In contrast, others believe that free will is an essential component of human nature. Although the universe appears to operate in a deterministic way, the idea of free will is instrumental in our moral accountability and individual identity.

One thing that separates us as humans from animals is that we take responsibility for our actions. An animal acts purely based on its desires; a lion cannot be held accountable for killing a gazelle. On the other hand, humans can be punished for their unjust acts. This innate responsibility and accountability follows from the belief that humans have free will, that we choose to transgress. We must be responsible for our actions if there were alternate actions we could have taken. In a debate with English philosopher Thomas Hobbes, Dr. John Bramhall argued exactly this. He stated: “No man blames fire for burning whole cities; no man taxes poison for destroying men; but [he only blames] those persons who apply them to such wicked ends. If the will of man be not in his own disposition, he is no more a free agent than the fire or the poison.” Our world is built on the punishment of immoral actions. In many cases, a man only acts good because he is required to do so. If there was no free will, he could not be held accountable for his actions and all punishments would be baseless.

In addition to moral accountability, the idea of free will is also essential in our sense of personal identity. In his book _Being and Nothingness_, French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre suggests that our choices define who we are, and that without the ability to make choices, we would be nothing more than objects in the world. Sartre believes that humans have the ability to transcend their circumstances, “project forward”, and make choices that create their own identities. He argues that when we make a moral decision, we are not just choosing between different options—we are also choosing what kind of person we want to be. For example, when we choose to tell the truth instead of lying, we are not just choosing the "right" action—we are also choosing to be a truthful person. Free will is necessary for this development of identity. A purely deterministic system would take this away.

Breakthroughs in science suggest that the universe is deterministic. Everything exists in the movement of invisible atoms. Our consciousness is just neurons firing inside our skulls. How can one be free to will in this situation? While it is true that the universe appears to operate in a deterministic way, this does not necessarily mean that free will is an illusion. St. Augustine of Hippo targets this idea in his book _The City of God_. In his writing, he takes the determinist universe to be like God, who “knows unchangeably all things which shall be.” Augustine argues that, even though there is a God who knows everything, we still have the ability to make and act on our choices. This is because our wills work in conjunction with the will of God to predetermine things. God's foreknowledge of future events is based on his infinite wisdom and understanding of human nature, rather than on any causal relationship between God's knowledge and human actions. Therefore, even if the universe operates deterministically, it is still possible that humans have free will because our wills are part of the determining process.

The debate about free will has been ongoing for centuries, with some philosophers arguing that our choices are determined by the laws of physics and others arguing that free will is an essential component of human nature. While breakthroughs in science suggest that the universe is deterministic, the idea of free will remains instrumental in our moral accountability and personal identity. Without free will, we would not be able to take responsibility for our actions, nor would we be able to define ourselves as individuals. Even the deterministic universe suggested by science remains compatible with free will. When considering all these factors, it becomes clear that humans, as Sartre puts it, are “condemned to be free.”
