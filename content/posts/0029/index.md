Of all the classes that I have taken so far, Philosophy has had the largest impact on me. I took it earlier this year at [Foothill College](https://foothill.edu) on a whim, and I am glad that I did.

First, there are the more straightforward benefits of the class. It was very writing-heavy, with a 900 word essay and two shorter 200 word responses due every week. The midterm exam was a 5 page paper, and the final was two 2 Â½ page papers. My writing, especially about complex topics, increased as a result of the course.

Second, there are the philosophical benefits. I feel as if a whole field of knowledge has been opened to me. Before, epistemology, ontology, or ethics never even crossed my mind. Now, I can think about these topics critically and form my own opinions.

Unfortunately, philosophical texts are incredibly dense and hard to read. They are definitely not your everyday novels. I admit, I have only ever finished a handful of philosophical books, choosing instead to read excerpts and essays. In this limited fashion, I have read Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, Kant, Sartre, and so on.

In my opinion, excerpts are an easy way to get into philosophy. They take what can sometimes be a 1000+ page tome, and give you a taste of a main argument for an idea. The textbook I used in my course was Cottingham's [_Western Philosophy: An Anthology_](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Western+Philosophy%3A+An+Anthology%2C+2nd+Edition-p-9781405124775), which, as it says in the title, is an anthology of western philosophical texts. For someone getting into philosophy, this is an easy way to get your foot in the door.

I highly recommend everyone read philosophy and not be discouraged by the difficult nature of writings in the field. No one is expecting you to takle Kant as your first read; instead, you can get a quick overview of major philosophical texts by reading an anthology of excerpts.
