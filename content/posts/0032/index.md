I want to love [Morning Brew](https://www.morningbrew.com/). I really do. It's a newsletter that puts an overview of the news in your email inbox every morning. In all honesty, I think its a great way to get a quick sense of what's going on in the world. There is just one issue: it's a newsletter.

I hate newsletters. Why? Newsletters are delivered with email, which is designed for two-way communication, not one-way broadcasts. Email is best used for conversations between two or more people who share a personal connection. In other words, email is for talking, not reading.

Most newsletters disable comments, often use unsupported HTML, and automate messages to _forcibly_ use email to disseminate information. Think about it: everything annoying in your email inbox is a newsletter that isn't doing what email is designed to do. Its forcing its way into a service because it's popular, not because it's the right choice.

What if you could separate newsletters into a different app? Instead of email, newsletters should use RSS, which is designed to be one-way. This is better for the user, who can deal with newsletters together with all their other news. It's better for the newsletter, which no longer has to implement hacky workarounds to avoid bugs in email.

That's also the reason that this blog doesn't offer a newsletter, only RSS. This blog is mostly one-way communication. If you want to comment, where do I direct you? Email.

But, for some reason, many newsletters just won't switch. This is the reason I hate Morning Brew. It insists on forcing its way into my inbox, instead of letting me decide on how to deal with it's posts.

There is no reason to make newsletters in the modern day. Please, just publish with RSS.
