      <description>The beginning of the end.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My senior year of high school started on Monday. I am expecting a brutal few months, filled with countlessly revising long college essays in the hopes of gaining admission somewhere I won&rsquo;t totally hate.</p>
<p>It is not all bad, though. I really only have three difficult classes: Honors English, AP Psychology, and AP Macroeconomics. I may decide to self-study AP Literature, but I don&rsquo;t know yet.</p>
<p>The school is also giving us Tuesdays and Thursdays off, and Fridays are half-days, so every week is more-or-less an easy week. And there is a big international trip in December I am looking forward to.</p>
<p>As to how this development relates to the blog, I&rsquo;m not sure. I may not write as much if I am overburdened with work during the school year. Or, I may write a lot now that I have another source of stimuli and reflection in my life. Who knows?</p>

      <title>On Sleep</title>

      <description>I really need more of it...</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>It is He who made the night a garment for you, and sleep a rest, and made the day like a resurrection. (Quran 25:47)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>School has started up again this week. On the second day of English class, the teacher showed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MuIMqhT8DM">this Ted Talk</a> about sleep to us. The video discussed the numerous consequenses of not getting a good night&rsquo;s sleep. The ones that stood out most to me were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lowered intelligence by 40%</li>
<li>Inability to commit events to long-term memory</li>
<li>Increase in rates of car accidents and heart attacks</li>
<li>Promotion of cancer and harm to the immune system</li>
</ul>
<p>I really need to start focusing on my sleep. My nighttime routine involves washing up, praying, and reading a book before slowly drifting to sleep. Some nights, I don&rsquo;t fall asleep until 1am. I will just lie there with my eyes open for an hour and half, blink, and wake up five hours later.</p>
<p>The most simple improvement is just going to bed earlier. Reading action-packed novels can keep my mind awake long after I put the book down, so avoiding these types of books when I am winding down is also key.</p>
<p>Here is the video. I encourage everyone to watch it.</p>

      <title>Operating Systems Are Bloated</title>
      <link>https://omega1510.github.io/blog/posts/0008/</link>

      <description>There are so many apps included, and you have to use them.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been using Pop_OS!, a popular Linux distribution, on my laptop for years. Recently, I also switched my old desktop over to the lightweight operating system. When people argue over what system is the best, they often only consider macOS or Windows. However, a user of either system will not consider where both fail because they have never experienced what they could have had. Because I use neither, I think I can provide a unique perspective on the shortcomings of both options.</p>
<p>I first had the idea to write about this when I replaced the Gnome desktop environment that came default with Pop_OS! with another piece of software called i3. It was a much better experience, and I wondered why other people do not make similar modifications to their computers. I soon realized, however, that modifications like this are not even possible when you are using a more conventional operating system.</p>
<p>Historically, operating systems did what they said on the can: operate the system. They allowed applications, which were defined by the user, to communicate with the computer&rsquo;s hardware, and vice-versa.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/blog/posts/0008/operating-system.svg" type="" alt="The historical role of operating systems."  /></p>
<p>But now, operating systems have gone from being a simple interface between applications and hardware to all-powerful processes demanding the user&rsquo;s complete submission. Gone are the days of choosing what your computer runs; operating systems provide default apps, and you <strong>must</strong> use them.</p>
<p>Many points of contention in the &ldquo;what OS is best&rdquo; debate arise from the operating system making decisions for you and not letting you change its choice. For example, people argue over the placement of buttons on either the top-left or top-right corner. macOS has gone with the former option, while Windows chooses the latter. But this decision should never have been the OS&rsquo;s to make! This decision has always been made by the user when they installed a desktop environment; who let Apple or Microsoft choose?</p>
<p>To illustrate again: Microsoft recently rounded the corners of windows in a visual revamp of their operating system. Historically, this has been an option in applications called compositors, which the user could choose to install. If they weren&rsquo;t satisfied with one, they could choose another. By rounding corners of windows with no way to undo it, Microsoft made a decision that the user had the right to make.</p>
<p>I suppose that Apple and Microsoft are doing this in the name of &ldquo;crafting an experience.&rdquo; I have nothing against that. In fact, I applaud them for taking the time to create great applications, like desktop environments, window managers, and compositors, and including them with their operating systems. I take issue with the fact that they have stolen the user&rsquo;s ability to switch to another application they find better.</p>
<p>Both tech giants already include apps that fit this philosophy. Apple provides Disk Utility on their computers, a great app to format and manage storage drives on your computer. They also don&rsquo;t force you to use it, letting you install other drive-managing software. If they took this stance with other parts of their operating systems, it would be better for everyone. Regular users would get their default apps and experience, while advanced ones could install they apps they want installed.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I&rsquo;ll stick with Linux, where I can choose exactly what code my CPU is crunching through.</p>

      <title>Watches Aren&#39;t Investments</title>
      <link>https://omega1510.github.io/blog/posts/0007/</link>

      <description>They are emotional purchases, not rational ones.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the owner of a <em>very</em> small and cheap watch collection, I am in no way qualified to comment on the practice of buying luxury watches as investment opportunities. My most expensive watch does not even crack four figures, and none of the pieces in my collection are likely to provide me a return-on-investment.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Still—whether out of spite or because I have no stake in the result, I don&rsquo;t know—I am going to write out my opinion on the matter.</p>
<p>An argument can be made that watches are great investments. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-16/luxury-swiss-watches-still-beat-stocks-and-crypto-despite-rolex-and-patek-drop">According to Bloomberg</a>, luxury Swiss watches have consistently beat stocks and crypto over the past few years. I am bombarded with videos of millionaire watch salesmen preaching the benefits of buying a $50,000 Patek Phillipe.</p>
<p>However, this betrays the real reason people should be buying watches. Many decades ago, watches were tools; now, they are jewelry. Nonetheless, like all tools or jewelry, watches are meant to be <em>worn</em>, not locked up in a safety deposit box. Yes, every dent on the case and scratch on the crystal drains value, but it adds character.</p>
<p>And watches aren&rsquo;t meant to be investments, either. If someone had cash to burn and wanted to grow it, they would invest in something much more lucrative. We buy watches because we <em>like</em> them; it is a deeply emotional purchase. I think we are too fed up with how it holds value or how it looks on our wrist, not about how much we like it. To reduce something so beautiful, with such intricate engineering, to just an investment is a disservice to the world of horology.</p>

      <title>Condemned to Be Free</title>
      <link>https://omega1510.github.io/blog/posts/0006/</link>

      <description>Do humans have free will?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This essay was submitted in partial fulfillment of an Intro to Philosophy course at <a href="https://www.foothill.edu/">Foothill College</a>.</em></p>
<p>For centuries, philosophers have debated what free will is and whether we even possess it. In an increasingly scientific world, some of them argue that our choices are determined only by the laws of physics. In contrast, others believe that free will is an essential component of human nature. Although the universe appears to operate in a deterministic way, the idea of free will is instrumental in our moral accountability and individual identity.</p>
<p>One thing that separates us as humans from animals is that we take responsibility for our actions. An animal acts purely based on its desires; a lion cannot be held accountable for killing a gazelle. On the other hand, humans can be punished for their unjust acts. This innate responsibility and accountability follows from the belief that humans have free will, that we choose to transgress. We must be responsible for our actions if there were alternate actions we could have taken. In a debate with English philosopher Thomas Hobbes, Dr. John Bramhall argued exactly this. He stated: “No man blames fire for burning whole cities; no man taxes poison for destroying men; but [he only blames] those persons who apply them to such wicked ends. If the will of man be not in his own disposition, he is no more a free agent than the fire or the poison.” Our world is built on the punishment of immoral actions. In many cases, a man only acts good because he is required to do so. If there was no free will, he could not be held accountable for his actions and all punishments would be baseless.</p>
<p>In addition to moral accountability, the idea of free will is also essential in our sense of personal identity. In his book <em>Being and Nothingness</em>, French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre suggests that our choices define who we are, and that without the ability to make choices, we would be nothing more than objects in the world. Sartre believes that humans have the ability to transcend their circumstances, “project forward”, and make choices that create their own identities. He argues that when we make a moral decision, we are not just choosing between different options—we are also choosing what kind of person we want to be. For example, when we choose to tell the truth instead of lying, we are not just choosing the &ldquo;right&rdquo; action—we are also choosing to be a truthful person. Free will is necessary for this development of identity. A purely deterministic system would take this away.</p>
<p>Breakthroughs in science suggest that the universe is deterministic. Everything exists in the movement of invisible atoms. Our consciousness is just neurons firing inside our skulls. How can one be free to will in this situation? While it is true that the universe appears to operate in a deterministic way, this does not necessarily mean that free will is an illusion. St. Augustine of Hippo targets this idea in his book <em>The City of God</em>. In his writing, he takes the determinist universe to be like God, who “knows unchangeably all things which shall be.” Augustine argues that, even though there is a God who knows everything, we still have the ability to make and act on our choices. This is because our wills work in conjunction with the will of God to predetermine things. God&rsquo;s foreknowledge of future events is based on his infinite wisdom and understanding of human nature, rather than on any causal relationship between God&rsquo;s knowledge and human actions. Therefore, even if the universe operates deterministically, it is still possible that humans have free will because our wills are part of the determining process.</p>
<p>The debate about free will has been ongoing for centuries, with some philosophers arguing that our choices are determined by the laws of physics and others arguing that free will is an essential component of human nature. While breakthroughs in science suggest that the universe is deterministic, the idea of free will remains instrumental in our moral accountability and personal identity. Without free will, we would not be able to take responsibility for our actions, nor would we be able to define ourselves as individuals. Even the deterministic universe suggested by science remains compatible with free will. When considering all these factors, it becomes clear that humans, as Sartre puts it, are “condemned to be free.”</p>

      <title>Do Evil People Exist?</title>
      <link>https://omega1510.github.io/blog/posts/0005/</link>

      <description>What does &amp;#34;evil&amp;#34; even mean?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This question was first asked to me nearly a decade ago by an elementary school teacher. It has stuck with me all these years because, as far as I can tell, it was my first introduction to the world of philosophy. When the teacher asked it to that group of young third-graders, no one could answer him. Now, I think I might have a response.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-an-evil-action">What is an Evil Action?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>An evil intention perverts the best actions, and makes them sins.<br>
— Joseph Addison</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To clear up any ambiguity, we need to determine what exactly makes an action evil. We may define it very broadly, such that an evil action is one where there is even a small amount of immorality present, regardless of the greater good. This would include the classical &ldquo;bad&rdquo; actions, like murder and lying, as well as immoral acts performed for a large benefit, as in the case of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem">trolley problem</a>. Nearly every action we perform could be considered evil under this definition. An action performed solely for our benefit could be considered selfish, and therefore evil, for example.</p>
<p>Instead, one may limit the broad definition of evil, stating that an evil action is any action where the bad in it outweighs the good. This definition necessarily encompasses all immoral acts while omitting ones performed for the greater good.</p>
<p>A second alternative is a strict definition, where an action must be completely morally wrong, without any shred of good, for it to be considered evil. With this view, we omit many actions that are technically wrong but that nobody would call &ldquo;evil,&rdquo; such as white lies, for even a white lie would be beneficial to someone. However, we also exclude nearly every immoral act because most of them contain at least a little good; they are, so to speak, for the lesser good, but still good nonetheless.</p>
<p>I find the second definition—the limited yet broad one—to be the most appealing. It leaves wiggle room for actions performed for the greater good but includes things we would normally consider evil, like homicide.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-an-evil-person">What is an Evil Person?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>To prefer evil to good is not in human nature; and when a man is compelled to choose one of two evils, no one will choose the greater when he might have the less.<br>
— Plato</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An evil person could be someone who simply performs bad actions, no matter how little. If we accept this definition, in combination with either broad definition of evil, to be evil is to be human because men are not angels: we always incline towards a little bit of sin as consequence of our free will.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>If we consider an evil person as someone who performs only evil and no good, we get nowhere. Even Hitler, who we can all agree is evil, still paid his officers' wages. He did not wake up every morning with <em>just</em> the intention to kill. If we take this approach, no one in the history of mankind has been evil.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the best definition of an evil person, as with the case of evil actions, is someone who performs more evil than they do good. With this definition and the medium definition of evil, all the classical &ldquo;evil&rdquo; figures—Stalin, Hitler, Mao—would all be considered evil.</p>
<p>The answer to the question &ldquo;Do evil people exist?&rdquo; depends on your definition of &ldquo;evil&rdquo; and &ldquo;evil person.&rdquo; It can be argued that everybody is evil, or nobody is evil, or that only a few bad figures are evil. It is a matter of nuance and personal preference, and there is no right answer.</p>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence and Copyright</title>

      <description>Court rules that AI-generated images can&amp;#39;t be copyrighted.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, a U.S. District Judge <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/ai-generated-art-cannot-receive-copyrights-us-court-says-2023-08-21/">ruled</a> that images created solely by artifical intelligence without any human input cannot be copyrighted under U.S. copyright law. He stated that human authorship is a prerequisite for copyright, and simply owning the AI responsible for generating a work is not enough to give you authorship of its creation. I am very interested in seeing how this precedent plays out in court cases in the coming years.</p>
<p>In particular, the issue of how much editing a human needs to do to the generated content for it to be considered a derivative work is of paramount importance and interest. If you have ChatGPT write an article, but you make a website and post it online, is that enough &ldquo;modification&rdquo; for you to be given ownership over the work?<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> What if you perform minimal edits, like removing the [YOUR NAME] bits the AI sometimes outputs? Is that &ldquo;modification?&rdquo; SAG-AFTRA, the Hollywood writers union that is currently on strike over the use of AI in the industry, has a vested interest in not allowing copyrighting of works where even a little bit of generative AI was used.</p>
<p>AI is meant to be used like an assistant. So if you and your assistant work on something together, and your assistant releases it to the public domain, how much editing to you need to do for you to claw back ownership and copyright it?</p>
<p>I am going to be closely following developments in the realm of artificial intelligence and copyright; I find this field, filled with moral landmines and massive grey areas, to be fascinating.</p>
<section class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>

<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>By the way, absolutely no generative AI is used when writing for this blog.

Sorry OpenAI, I prefer to think for myself.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

      <title>My Thoughts on The Double</title>
      <link>https://omega1510.github.io/blog/posts/0003/</link>

      <description>It was a blood-curdling, psychological exploration of identity with an underwhelming plot.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>Sorrow is concealed in gilded palaces, and there’s no escaping it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Last night I finished reading <em>The Double: A Petersburg Poem</em>. It is the third of Dostoevsky&rsquo;s works that I have read. I am usually a huge fan of the author; my favorite book is <em>Crime and Punishment</em> and I also loved <em>Notes from the Underground</em>. I love the deep explorations of morality and psychology that are woven throughout his books. His dialogue is unlike anything else that I have read: it is so real, personal, and engaging.</p>
<p><em>The Double</em> was an impulse buy from the bookstore on Stanford&rsquo;s campus. I was looking for a copy of <em>The Idiot</em> or <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em>, but <em>The Double</em> caught my eye instead. The description on the back piqued my interest even further. I bought the book, thinking that I was in for an enjoyable and thought-provoking read.</p>
<p>Boy, was I wrong. <em>The Double</em> was nothing like <em>Crime</em> or <em>Notes</em>. In my opinion, this is one of Dostoevsky&rsquo;s weaker works and was not very enjoyable to read. I found the plot drawn out and repetitive, and the prose difficult to read. I would normally attribute the latter gripe to the translator, but I have read elswhere that the original Russian text of the book was just as complicated.</p>
<p>The dialogue and psychological exploration was still outstanding, marking the novel as distinctly Dostoevskian. Similar to his other novels, it features an blood-curdling ability to force you into the protagonist&rsquo;s head. I felt like I was inside his thoughts, following him hand-in-hand in his psychological descent.</p>
<p>However, this forte was held back by a plot I could not fully understand. It closely followed the protagonist&rsquo;s actions, but when your protagonist is an anxious schizophrenic, the story becomes incredibly confusing.</p>
<p>In the end, I agree with Dostoevsky&rsquo;s own opinion of the work. He stated in <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Writer%27s_Diary">A Writer&rsquo;s Diary</a></em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most decidedly, I did not succeed with that novel; however, its idea was rather lucid, and I have never expressed in my writings anything more serious. Still, as far as form was concerned, I failed utterly.</p>

      <title>Why is Reading Gendered?</title>
      <link>https://omega1510.github.io/blog/posts/0002/</link>

      <description>Where did all the fiction-loving men go?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I read a lot. Now that I think about it, I probably read too much. I stay up for hours most nights engrossed in the expansive world behind my Kindle&rsquo;s screen, dying to learn about the latest adventure the protagonist has gotten caught up in.</p>
<p>When introducing myself to someone new, I usually say that I read books as a hobby. Recently, a girl I was talking to asked me my favorite book. &ldquo;<em>Crime and Punishment</em>,&rdquo; I responded. She replied, &ldquo;Dostoevsky, right?&rdquo; I can&rsquo;t convey on paper how much joy I felt in that moment.</p>
<p>I realized that my life was missing someone I could really talk to about what I&rsquo;m reading. Unfortunately, I&rsquo;m the only male I know who loves fiction in this way. Some of my friends will gladly read the latest self-help book or thousand-page physics tome, but none of them can get lost in the pages of a good novel.</p>
<p>I wish I had a friend group with whom I could discuss the literature I find myself consumed by. Some people to talk to about the things on my mind. I believe that many men are in a similar situation to myself.</p>
<p>So my question is, when did reading fiction become a woman&rsquo;s thing to do? The statistics are clear: Goodreads <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/blog/show/475-sex-and-reading-a-look-at-who-s-reading-whom">reported</a> in 2014 that women read two times more books published that year than their male counterparts.</p>
<p>What is the cause? According to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-422X(00)00003-6">a study</a> published in 2000, girls are more likely to be encouraged by their parents to read at a young age and usually have more free-time to do so later in life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a shame that a hobby like reading, widely considered to provide social, intellectual, and personal benefits, must be a gendered activity. To all the parents out there, encourage your sons to read!</p>

      <description>Why I write.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fitting for the first post on this blog to be an explanation of why I&rsquo;m writing.</p>
<p>One of my friends recently began posting more of his thoughts on social media because he felt that writing had taken a backseat in his life. He wanted to rekindle that quickly fading love for the pen. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the case with me.</p>
<p>Neither do I want to attract followers or make money. If I wanted to do that, I would be posting AI-generated content somewhere with more eyes, like Medium.</p>
<p>I discovered a quote that I think sums up my thoughts nicely. Amit G. <a href="https://amitg.blog/my-daughter-was-writing-in-her-journal-today-and-casually-asked-me-why-she-does">writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My daughter went on to scribble happily in her journal. Once she was done, she said, “I love how I feel when I capture everything on my mind in these pages.”</p>
<p>Even I want that now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I want to write because there is something trapped inside of me angry that I won&rsquo;t let it out. There are way to many thoughts in my head, fighting to be put down on paper. I want this blog to be a place where I can let the little <a href="https://allpoetry.com/poem/8509539-Bluebird-by-Charles-Bukowski">bluebird</a> in my soul roam free, at least for a little while.</p>
<h2 id="future-plans">Future Plans</h2>
<p>This blog will have absolutely no AI-generated content. It will have no advertisements, tracking, or harvesting of data. It will be raw and free: a place where I can write down my thoughts for the world to see.</p>
<p>I recently came across <a href="https://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/">Julia Cameron&rsquo;s Morning Pages</a>, where you write three pages from the heart stream-of-conciousness style every morning. That&rsquo;s a little too hardcore for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m aiming for posting about 300 words every day on this blog. Some days I&rsquo;ll write more, some days less. It&rsquo;s all about building a habit. Let&rsquo;s see how it goes.</p>
