      <title>My Thoughts on The Double</title>

      <description>It was a blood-curdling, psychological exploration of identity with an underwhelming plot.</description>

<p>Sorrow is concealed in gilded palaces, and thereâ€™s no escaping it.</p>

<p>Last night I finished reading <em>The Double: A Petersburg Poem</em>. It is the third of Dostoevsky&rsquo;s works that I have read. I am usually a huge fan of the author; my favorite book is <em>Crime and Punishment</em> and I also loved <em>Notes from the Underground</em>. I love the deep explorations of morality and psychology that are woven throughout his books. His dialogue is unlike anything else that I have read: it is so real, personal, and engaging.</p>
<p><em>The Double</em> was an impulse buy from the bookstore on Stanford&rsquo;s campus. I was looking for a copy of <em>The Idiot</em> or <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em>, but <em>The Double</em> caught my eye instead. The description on the back piqued my interest even further. I bought the book, thinking that I was in for an enjoyable and thought-provoking read.</p>
<p>Boy, was I wrong. <em>The Double</em> was nothing like <em>Crime</em> or <em>Notes</em>. In my opinion, this is one of Dostoevsky&rsquo;s weaker works and was not very enjoyable to read. I found the plot drawn out and repetitive, and the prose difficult to read. I would normally attribute the latter gripe to the translator, but I have read elswhere that the original Russian text of the book was just as complicated.</p>
<p>The dialogue and psychological exploration was still outstanding, marking the novel as distinctly Dostoevskian. Similar to his other novels, it features an blood-curdling ability to force you into the protagonist&rsquo;s head. I felt like I was inside his thoughts, following him hand-in-hand in his psychological descent.</p>
<p>However, this forte was held back by a plot I could not fully understand. It closely followed the protagonist&rsquo;s actions, but when your protagonist is an anxious schizophrenic, the story becomes incredibly confusing.</p>
<p>In the end, I agree with Dostoevsky&rsquo;s own opinion of the work. He stated in <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Writer%27s_Diary">A Writer&rsquo;s Diary</a></em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most decidedly, I did not succeed with that novel; however, its idea was rather lucid, and I have never expressed in my writings anything more serious. Still, as far as form was concerned, I failed utterly.</p>

      <title>Why is Reading Gendered?</title>
      <link>https://omega1510.github.io/blog/posts/0002-why-is-reading-gendered/</link>

      <description>Where did all the fiction-loving men go?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I read a lot. Now that I think about it, I probably read too much. I stay up for hours most nights engrossed in the expansive world behind my Kindle&rsquo;s screen, dying to learn about the latest adventure the protagonist has gotten caught up in.</p>
<p>When introducing myself to someone new, I usually say that I read books as a hobby. Recently, a girl I was talking to asked me my favorite book. &ldquo;<em>Crime and Punishment</em>,&rdquo; I responded. She replied, &ldquo;Dostoevsky, right?&rdquo; I can&rsquo;t convey on paper how much joy I felt in that moment.</p>
<p>I realized that my life was missing someone I could really talk to about what I&rsquo;m reading. Unfortunately, I&rsquo;m the only male I know who loves fiction in this way. Some of my friends will gladly read the latest self-help book or thousand-page physics tome, but none of them can get lost in the pages of a good novel.</p>
<p>I wish I had a friend group with whom I could discuss the literature I find myself consumed by. Some people to talk to about the things on my mind. I believe that many men are in a similar situation to myself.</p>
<p>So my question is, when did reading fiction become a woman&rsquo;s thing to do? The statistics are clear: Goodreads <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/blog/show/475-sex-and-reading-a-look-at-who-s-reading-whom">reported</a> in 2014 that women read two times more books published that year than their male counterparts.</p>
<p>What is the cause? According to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-422X(00)00003-6">a study</a> published in 2000, girls are more likely to be encouraged by their parents to read at a young age and usually have more free-time to do so later in life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a shame that a hobby like reading, widely considered to provide social, intellectual, and personal benefits, must be a gendered activity. To all the parents out there, encourage your sons to read!</p>
