This post is an addendum to [yesterday's post](../0016) about Thomas Aquinas's five ways to argue for the existence of God. In the same book where his arguments were published, the [Summa Theologica](https://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm#article3), the Catholic philosopher addressed a possible objection to the omnipotence of God.

He begins by describing the objection:

> It seems that God does not exist; because if one of two contraries be infinite, the other would be altogether destroyed. But the word "God" means that He is infinite goodness. If, therefore, God existed, there would be no evil discoverable; but there is evil in the world. Therefore God does not exist.

What does Aquinas mean by this? He first states a premise that two infinite things—good and evil in the passage—cannot both exist together. If either one is infinite, then it must overpower the other. For example, a world with an infinite source of good cannot contain any evil. Furthermore, if God exists, then He must be infinitely good, and His goodness must overpower all evil in the universe. However, there is clearly evil present in the world we live in. Therefore God, or at least an omnipotent one, cannot exist our universe.

On the surface, this objection seems convincing. It strikes an emotional chord with most people, who have been through calamities in their lives and often questioned the supremacy of God thereafter. The objection is a variation of the classic question: "why do bad things happen to good people?"

Aquinas addresses this remonstration by citing Augustine of Hippo, a bishop who defended Christianity against philosophical attacks in his writings. Augustine argues that God's power is so great that He would not allow evil to exist unless he could bring good out of evil; therefore, even a universe with evil in it can contain an infinitely good God because all evil actions have the potential for good.

As Aquinas puts it:

> This is part of the infinite goodness [and mercy] of God, that He should allow evil to exist, and out of it produce good.
