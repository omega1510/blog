A year or so ago, I learned the Rust[^1] programming language. Since its first stable release in 2015, it has quickly developed a hold on the world of systems programming. It is well loved because it enforces memory safety, something many existing systems languages, like C, do not.

Rust was designed from the ground up to be a _systems_ programming language, used to build performance-critical software like operating systems and embedded applications. But then people go and try to build websites with it. I admit, I [am](https://github.com/omega1510/webassembly) [guilty](https://github.com/omega1510/todo) of this, too.

What I have learned, though, is that things are often easier when you use the right tool for the job. As much as I hate javascript, I will still use it if I need to build a website. And as much as I love Rust, I will come running back Python for any data manipulation.

Picking the right tool from the outset saves you from _so_ much frustration. For example, I have sunk countless hours into modifying and customizing my macOS system, something it is clearly not meant to allow. I have also put in large amounts of effort to try and get Windows games running on other operating systems. I could have avoided stress and frustration if I had customized Linux instead and ran Windows to play games.

Making something do a thing it wasn't meant to do is akin to taking an exam with a piece of charcoal instead of a pencil. Sure, it works in theory, but it's so stupid no one would actually do it. But when it comes to software, everyone suddenly calls it innovation, not stupidity.
