I have been using Pop_OS!, a popular Linux distribution, on my laptop for years. Recently, I also switched my old desktop over to the lightweight operating system. When people argue over what system is the best, they often only consider macOS or Windows. However, a user of either system will not consider where both fail because they have never experienced what they could have had. Because I use neither, I think I can provide a unique perspective on the shortcomings of both options.

I first had the idea to write about this when I replaced the Gnome desktop environment that came default with Pop_OS! with another piece of software called i3. It was a much better experience, and I wondered why other people do not make similar modifications to their computers. I soon realized, however, that modifications like this are not even possible when you are using a more conventional operating system.

Historically, operating systems did what they said on the can: operate the system. They allowed applications, which were defined by the user, to communicate with the computer's hardware, and vice-versa.

But now, operating systems have gone from being a simple interface between applications and hardware to all-powerful processes demanding the user's complete submission. Gone are the days of choosing what your computer runs; operating systems provide default apps, and you **must** use them.

Many points of contention in the "what OS is best" debate arise from the operating system making decisions for you and not letting you change its choice. For example, people argue over the placement of buttons on either the top-left or top-right corner. macOS has gone with the former option, while Windows chooses the latter. But this decision should never have been the OS's to make! This decision has always been made by the user when they installed a desktop environment; who let Apple or Microsoft choose?

To illustrate again: Microsoft recently rounded the corners of windows in a visual revamp of their operating system. Historically, this has been an option in applications called compositors, which the user could choose to install. If they weren't satisfied with one, they could choose another. By rounding corners of windows with no way to undo it, Microsoft made a decision that the user had the right to make.

I suppose that Apple and Microsoft are doing this in the name of "crafting an experience." I have nothing against that. In fact, I applaud them for taking the time to create great applications, like desktop environments, window managers, and compositors, and including them with their operating systems. I take issue with the fact that they have stolen the user's ability to switch to another application they find better.

Both tech giants already include apps that fit this philosophy. Apple provides Disk Utility on their computers, a great app to format and manage storage drives on your computer. They also don't force you to use it, letting you install other drive-managing software. If they took this stance with other parts of their operating systems, it would be better for everyone. Regular users would get their default apps and experience, while advanced ones could install they apps they want installed.

In the meantime, I'll stick with Linux, where I can choose exactly what code my CPU is crunching through.
