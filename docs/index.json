[{"content":" Sorrow is concealed in gilded palaces, and there’s no escaping it.\n Last night I finished reading The Double: A Petersburg Poem. It is the third of Dostoevsky\u0026rsquo;s works that I have read. I am usually a huge fan of the author; my favorite book is Crime and Punishment and I also loved Notes from the Underground. I love the deep explorations of morality and psychology that are woven throughout his books. His dialogue is unlike anything else that I have read: it is so real, personal, and engaging.\nThe Double was an impulse buy from the bookstore on Stanford\u0026rsquo;s campus. I was looking for a copy of The Idiot or The Brothers Karamazov, but The Double caught my eye instead. The description on the back piqued my interest even further. I bought the book, thinking that I was in for an enjoyable and thought-provoking read.\nBoy, was I wrong. The Double was nothing like Crime or Notes. In my opinion, this is one of Dostoevsky\u0026rsquo;s weaker works and was not very enjoyable to read. I found the plot drawn out and repetitive, and the prose difficult to read. I would normally attribute the latter gripe to the translator, but I have read elswhere that the original Russian text of the book was just as complicated.\nThe dialogue and psychological exploration was still outstanding, marking the novel as distinctly Dostoevskian. Similar to his other novels, it features an blood-curdling ability to force you into the protagonist\u0026rsquo;s head. I felt like I was inside his thoughts, following him hand-in-hand in his psychological descent.\nHowever, this forte was held back by a plot I could not fully understand. It closely followed the protagonist\u0026rsquo;s actions, but when your protagonist is an anxious schizophrenic, the story becomes incredibly confusing.\nIn the end, I agree with Dostoevsky\u0026rsquo;s own opinion of the work. He stated in A Writer\u0026rsquo;s Diary:\n Most decidedly, I did not succeed with that novel; however, its idea was rather lucid, and I have never expressed in my writings anything more serious. Still, as far as form was concerned, I failed utterly.\n ","permalink":"https://omega1510.github.io/blog/posts/0003-the-double/","summary":"Sorrow is concealed in gilded palaces, and there’s no escaping it.\n Last night I finished reading The Double: A Petersburg Poem.

Now that I think about it, I probably read too much. I stay up for hours most nights engrossed in the expansive world behind my Kindle\u0026rsquo;s screen, dying to learn about the latest adventure the protagonist has gotten caught up in.\nWhen introducing myself to someone new, I usually say that I read books as a hobby. Recently, a girl I was talking to asked me my favorite book. \u0026ldquo;Crime and Punishment,\u0026rdquo; I responded. She replied, \u0026ldquo;Dostoevsky, right?\u0026rdquo; I can\u0026rsquo;t convey on paper how much joy I felt in that moment.\nI realized that my life was missing someone I could really talk to about what I\u0026rsquo;m reading. Unfortunately, I\u0026rsquo;m the only male I know who loves fiction in this way. Some of my friends will gladly read the latest self-help book or thousand-page physics tome, but none of them can get lost in the pages of a good novel.\nI wish I had a friend group with whom I could discuss the literature I find myself consumed by. Some people to talk to about the things on my mind. I believe that many men are in a similar situation to myself.\nSo my question is, when did reading fiction become a woman\u0026rsquo;s thing to do? The statistics are clear: Goodreads reported in 2014 that women read two times more books published that year than their male counterparts.\nWhat is the cause? According to a study published in 2000, girls are more likely to be encouraged by their parents to read at a young age and usually have more free-time to do so later in life.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a shame that a hobby like reading, widely considered to provide social, intellectual, and personal benefits, must be a gendered activity. To all the parents out there, encourage your sons to read!\n","permalink":"https://omega1510.github.io/blog/posts/0002-why-is-reading-gendered/","summary":"I read a lot.

He wanted to rekindle that quickly fading love for the pen. I don\u0026rsquo;t think that\u0026rsquo;s the case with me.\nNeither do I want to attract followers or make money. If I wanted to do that, I would be posting AI-generated content somewhere with more eyes, like Medium.\nI discovered a quote that I think sums up my thoughts nicely. Amit G. writes:\n My daughter went on to scribble happily in her journal. Once she was done, she said, “I love how I feel when I capture everything on my mind in these pages.”\nEven I want that now.\n I want to write because there is something trapped inside of me angry that I won\u0026rsquo;t let it out. There are way to many thoughts in my head, fighting to be put down on paper. I want this blog to be a place where I can let the little bluebird in my soul roam free, at least for a little while.\nFuture Plans This blog will have absolutely no AI-generated content. It will have no advertisements, tracking, or harvesting of data. It will be raw and free: a place where I can write down my thoughts for the world to see.\nI recently came across Julia Cameron\u0026rsquo;s Morning Pages, where you write three pages from the heart stream-of-conciousness style every morning. That\u0026rsquo;s a little too hardcore for me.\nI\u0026rsquo;m aiming for posting about 300 words every day on this blog. Some days I\u0026rsquo;ll write more, some days less. It\u0026rsquo;s all about building a habit. Let\u0026rsquo;s see how it goes.\n","permalink":"https://omega1510.github.io/blog/posts/0001-hello-world/","summary":"Motivation I think it\u0026rsquo;s fitting for the first post on this blog to be an explanation of why I\u0026rsquo;m writing.\nOne of my friends recently began posting more of his thoughts on social media because he felt that writing had taken a backseat in his life.
