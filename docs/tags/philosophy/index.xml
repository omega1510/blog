      <description>What does &amp;#34;evil&amp;#34; even mean?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This question was first asked to me nearly a decade ago by an elementary school teacher. It has stuck with me all these years because, as far as I can tell, it was my first introduction to the world of philosophy. When the teacher asked it to that group of young third-graders, no one could answer him. Now, I think I might have a response.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-an-evil-action">What is an Evil Action?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>An evil intention perverts the best actions, and makes them sins.<br>
— Joseph Addison</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To clear up any ambiguity, we need to determine what exactly makes an action evil. We may define it very broadly, such that an evil action is one where there is even a small amount of immorality present, regardless of the greater good. This would include the classical &ldquo;bad&rdquo; actions, like murder and lying, as well as immoral acts performed for a large benefit, as in the case of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem">trolley problem</a>. Nearly every action we perform could be considered evil under this definition. An action performed solely for our benefit could be considered selfish, and therefore evil, for example.</p>
<p>Instead, one may limit the broad definition of evil, stating that an evil action is any action where the bad in it outweighs the good. This definition necessarily encompasses all immoral acts while omitting ones performed for the greater good.</p>
<p>A second alternative is a strict definition, where an action must be completely morally wrong, without any shred of good, for it to be considered evil. With this view, we omit many actions that are technically wrong but that nobody would call &ldquo;evil,&rdquo; such as white lies, for even a white lie would be beneficial to someone. However, we also exclude nearly every immoral act because most of them contain at least a little good; they are, so to speak, for the lesser good, but still good nonetheless.</p>
<p>I find the second definition—the limited yet broad one—to be the most appealing. It leaves wiggle room for actions performed for the greater good but includes things we would normally consider evil, like homicide.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-an-evil-person">What is an Evil Person?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>To prefer evil to good is not in human nature; and when a man is compelled to choose one of two evils, no one will choose the greater when he might have the less.<br>
— Plato</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An evil person could be someone who simply performs bad actions, no matter how little. If we accept this definition, in combination with either broad definition of evil, to be evil is to be human because men are not angels: we always incline towards a little bit of sin as consequence of our free will.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>If we consider an evil person as someone who performs only evil and no good, we get nowhere. Even Hitler, who we can all agree is evil, still paid his officers' wages. He did not wake up every morning with <em>just</em> the intention to kill. If we take this approach, no one in the history of mankind has been evil.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the best definition of an evil person, as with the case of evil actions, is someone who performs more evil than they do good. With this definition and the medium definition of evil, all the classical &ldquo;evil&rdquo; figures—Stalin, Hitler, Mao—would all be considered evil.</p>
<p>The answer to the question &ldquo;Do evil people exist?&rdquo; depends on your definition of &ldquo;evil&rdquo; and &ldquo;evil person.&rdquo; It can be argued that everybody is evil, or nobody is evil, or that only a few bad figures are evil. It is a matter of nuance and personal preference, and there is no right answer.</p>
