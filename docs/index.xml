      <title>First Class on Campus at Foothill</title>
      <link>https://hayaan.me/posts/0036/</link>

      <description>The class is hard and the campus is great.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been taking classes at <a href="https://foothill.edu">Foothill College</a> for nearly four years, but today was the first day that I took a class in-person.</p>
<p>I never realized what I was missing. The campus is much nicer than I expected from a community college. It has a nice, woody aesthetic, which is interesting given it&rsquo;s location in the heart of the concrete-and-glass jungle of Silicon Valley. Of course, it can&rsquo;t compete with a university like Stanford, but it almost holds up against Santa Clara University, a school I particularly liked.</p>
<p>The class I&rsquo;m taking is Chemistry 1A, the second Chemistry class the school offers. I am taking it two days a week, which means that the lab and lecture are on the same day. My lab is 3 hours straight at 9 in the morning, and it&rsquo;s definitely tiring.</p>
<p>The teacher is fine, but nothing special. I&rsquo;m looking forward to my first lab next week. I&rsquo;m not too hot on the timings, and don&rsquo;t know if I will continue the course. I probably will, but who knows?</p>

      <title>Think, Don&#39;t Talk</title>

      <description>A lesson from The Prophet.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Khalil Gibran writes in his book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prophet_(book)"><em>The Prophet</em></a> on talking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You talk when you cease to be at peace with your thoughts;<br>
And when you can no longer dwell in the solitude of your heart you live in your lips, and sound is a diversion and a pastime.<br>
And in much of your talking, thinking is half murdered.<br>
For thought is a bird of space, that in a cage of words may indeed unfold its wings but cannot fly.</p>
<p>There are those among you who seek the talkative through fear of being alone.<br>
The silence of aloneness reveals to their eyes their naked selves and they would escape.<br>
And there are those who talk, and without knowledge or forethought reveal a truth which they themselves do not understand.<br>
And there are those who have the truth within them, but they tell it not in words.<br>
In the bosom of such as these the spirit dwells in rhythmic silence.</p>
<p>When you meet your friend on the roadside or in the market place, let the spirit in you move your lips and direct your tongue.<br>
Let the voice within your voice speak to the ear of his ear;<br>
For his soul will keep the truth of your heart as the taste of the wine is remembered<br>
When the colour is forgotten and the vessel is no more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This passage highlights a very important idea when it comes to talking (or blogging). One can talk just to get away from his thoughts, or to spread them. These surface-level conversations (e.g. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s the weather?&quot;) serve as nothing but distractions.</p>
<p>Instead, we can talk about deeper topics. I feel that, as a society, we have moved away from stimulating conversations. For example, an average conversation in a 19th century novel I&rsquo;m reading is about the jurisdiction of ecclesiastical courts. That is not something that would be talked about today. In my opinion, we have lost something vital in this.</p>
<p>We have concentrated our focus in the second paragraph of the excerpt above. Those of us who talk don&rsquo;t think, and those of us who think don&rsquo;t talk. As with most things, perfection is found in balance.</p>

      <title>Come Forth, Ye Drunkards</title>

      <description>This is why I love Dostoevsky.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Without doubt, Dostoevsky is my favorite author. Imagine that you pick up a novel thinking it&rsquo;s just a regular story, and the author hits you with this passage in just the second chapter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;but He will pity us Who has had pity on all men, Who has understood all men and all things, He is the One, He too is the judge. He will come in that day and He will ask: &lsquo;Where is the daughter who gave herself for her cross, consumptive step-mother and for the little children of another? Where is the daughter who had pity upon the filthy drunkard, her earthly father, undismayed by his beastliness?&rsquo; And He will say, &lsquo;Come to me! I have already forgiven thee once&hellip;. I have forgiven thee once&hellip;. Thy sins which are many are forgiven thee for thou hast loved much&hellip;.&rsquo; He will forgive, I know it&hellip; And He will judge and will forgive all, the good and the evil, the wise and the meek&hellip;. And when He has done with all of them, then He will summon us. &lsquo;You too come forth,&rsquo; He will say, &lsquo;Come forth ye drunkards, come forth, ye weak ones, come forth, ye children of shame!&rsquo; And we shall all come forth, without shame and shall stand before him. And He will say unto us, &lsquo;Ye are swine, made in the Image of the Beast and with his mark; but come ye also!&rsquo; And the wise ones and those of understanding will say, &lsquo;Oh Lord, why dost Thou receive these men?&rsquo; And He will say, &lsquo;This is why I receive them, oh ye wise, this is why I receive them, oh ye of understanding, that not one of them believed himself to be worthy of this.&rsquo; And He will hold out His hands to us and we shall fall down before him&hellip; and we shall weep&hellip; and we shall understand all things! Then we shall understand all!&hellip; and all will understand&hellip;. Lord, Thy kingdom come!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is from the second chapter of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_and_Punishment"><em>Crime and Punishment</em></a>. As soon I read it, I was immediately ensnared by love for Dostoevsky&rsquo;s prose.</p>

      <title>On Inductive Reasoning in the Pursuit of Virtue</title>
      <link>https://hayaan.me/posts/0033/</link>

      <description>One cannot determine what virtue is by looking at virtuous actions.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>And now I know not what virtue is, and you seem to be in the same case, although you did once perhaps know.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus spoke Socrates in Plato&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1643/pg1643-images.html#:~:text=and%20now%20i%20know%20not%20what%20virtue%20is%2C%20and%20you%20seem%20to%20be%20in%20the%20same%20case%2C%20although%20you%20did%20once%20perhaps%20know"><em>Meno</em></a>. In my opinon, one of the great tradegies of the modern era is that so many of us have lost our way. We all fall short, in one way or another, in our life-long pursuit of virtue.</p>
<p>The problem has its foundation in the definition of virtue. For those of us that believe in a soul, Socrates among them, the definition is relatively easy to achieve. Our souls were in contact before our births with the True, the Good, and the Beautiful; defining virtue is simply remembering what we have once forgotten, hence Socrates' statement above.</p>
<p>But for those who deny the existence of the soul, or, in fact, any greater reality above the human experience, this approach is unapplicable. For someone like Kant, who argues that we cannot know the world as it is, we must define virtue <em>subjectively</em>, within the frameworks through which we experience reality.</p>
<p>A possible solution involves inductive reasoning, where you derive a general rule from the observation of many smaller incidents. Perhaps it is possible to define virtue by observing virtuous actions, and attempt to discover a general rule therein. However, while this form of reasoning is ubiquitous in scientific research, it does not apply here.</p>
<p>Plato addresses this approach early in his dialogue, <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1643/pg1643-images.html#:~:text=SOCRATES%3A%20Then%20as,Compare%20Arist.%20Pol.">Meno</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Socrates:</strong><br>
…By the gods, Meno, be generous, and tell me what you say that virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find that I have been mistaken, and that you… do really have this knowledge; although I have been just saying that I have never found anybody who had.</p>
<p><strong>Meno:</strong><br>
There will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering your question. Let us take first the virtue of a man—he should know how to administer the state, and in the administration of it to benefit his friends and harm his enemies; and he must also be careful not to suffer harm himself. A woman&rsquo;s virtue, if you wish to know about that, may also be easily described: her duty is to order her house, and keep what is indoors, and obey her husband. Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of each of us in all that we do. And the same may be said of vice, Socrates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ahh, the classic argument for subjective morality. Socrates makes no delay in swiftly pointing out its flaws, however:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Socrates:</strong><br>
When you say, Meno, that there is one virtue of a man, another of a woman, another of a child, and so on, does this apply only to virtue, or would you say the same of health, and size, and strength? Or is the nature of health always the same, whether in man or woman?</p>
<p><strong>Meno:</strong><br>
I should say that health is the same, both in man and woman.</p>
<p><strong>Socrates:</strong><br>
And is not this true of size and strength? If a woman is strong, she will be strong by reason of the same form and of the same strength subsisting in her which there is in the man. I mean to say that strength, as strength, whether of man or woman, is the same. Is there any difference?</p>
<p><strong>Meno:</strong><br>
I think not.</p>
<p><strong>Socrates:</strong><br>
And will not virtue, as virtue, be the same, whether in a child or in a grown-up person, in a woman or in a man?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, Socrates agrees that leading a state or maintaining a household are virtuous actions, but simply stating that they are does not constitute a definition of virtue. Instead, these actions all share a certain characteristic—that of true virtue—among other characteristics that differentiate them. To identify virtue by looking at virtuous actions, Socrates argues, we must identify a characteristic common to all virtuous actions, and not just give examples of the latter.</p>
<p>It is in this endeavor that difficulty lies. It is akin to me giving you an apple, an orange, and a peach, and asking you to give me an objective definition of what a fruit is. Incredibly difficult, if not impossible. Similarly, in ethics, it is incredibly difficult to derive a definition of virtue by considering virtuous actions.</p>
<p>A &ldquo;bottom-up&rdquo; approach is not effective in the pursuit of virtue. While it does seem like a good idea, inductive reasoning falls short in practice. A &ldquo;top-down&rdquo; perspective is much simpler, and as <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Occams-razor">Occam&rsquo;s Razor</a> tells us, is much more likely to be correct.</p>

      <title>Stop Making Newsletters</title>
      <link>https://hayaan.me/posts/0032/</link>

      <description>Or, why I hate Morning Brew.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I want to love <a href="https://www.morningbrew.com/">Morning Brew</a>. I really do. It&rsquo;s a newsletter that puts an overview of the news in your email inbox every morning. In all honesty, I think its a great way to get a quick sense of what&rsquo;s going on in the world. There is just one issue: it&rsquo;s a newsletter.</p>
<p>I hate newsletters. Why? Newsletters are delivered with email, which is designed for two-way communication, not one-way broadcasts. Email is best used for conversations between two or more people who share a personal connection. In other words, email is for talking, not reading.</p>
<p>Most newsletters disable comments, often use unsupported HTML, and automate messages to <em>forcibly</em> use email to disseminate information. Think about it: everything annoying in your email inbox is a newsletter that isn&rsquo;t doing what email is designed to do. Its forcing its way into a service because it&rsquo;s popular, not because it&rsquo;s the right choice.</p>
<p>What if you could separate newsletters into a different app? Instead of email, newsletters should use RSS, which is designed to be one-way. This is better for the user, who can deal with newsletters together with all their other news. It&rsquo;s better for the newsletter, which no longer has to implement hacky workarounds to avoid bugs in email.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also the reason that this blog doesn&rsquo;t offer a newsletter, only RSS. This blog is mostly one-way communication. If you want to comment, where do I direct you? Email.</p>
<p>But, for some reason, many newsletters just won&rsquo;t switch. This is the reason I hate Morning Brew. It insists on forcing its way into my inbox, instead of letting me decide on how to deal with it&rsquo;s posts.</p>
<p>There is no reason to make newsletters in the modern day. Please, just publish with RSS.</p>

      <description>A small milestone.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This blog&rsquo;s <a href="posts/0001/">first post</a> was on August 20. Today&rsquo;s date is September 20. That marks one month that this blog has been active. Yay!</p>
<p>I still don&rsquo;t feel any real effects from the blog. Maybe that will take a little bit longer. I do, however, look forward to posting every day, so that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>The next milestone will probably be at 6 months.</p>

      <title>On Denying the Truth</title>

      <description>Miracles do not lead to belief.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fyodor Dostoevsky writes in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brothers_Karamazov"><em>The Brothers Karamzov</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Miracles are never a stumbling-block to the realist. It is not miracles that dispose realist to belief. The genuine realist, if he is an unbeliever, will always find strength and ability to disbelieve in the miraculous, and if he is confronted with a miracle as an irrefutable fact he would rather disbelieve his own senses than admit that fact. Even if he admits it, he admits it as a fact of nature till then unrecognized by him. Faith does not, in the realist, spring from the miracle but the miracle from faith. If the realist once believes, then he is bound by his very realism to admit the miraculous also. The Apostle Thomas said that he would not believe till he saw, but when he did see he said, &ldquo;My Lord and my God!&rdquo; Was it the miracle forced him to believe? Most likely not, but he believed solely because he desired to believe and possibly he fully believed in his secret heart even when he said, &ldquo;I do not believe till I see.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am particularly struck by the line: &ldquo;…if he is confronted with a miracle as an irrefutable fact he would rather disbelieve his own senses than admit that fact.&rdquo; I was recently debating someone of a different religious leaning and pointed out an inconsistency in his religious books. He then denied the very veracity of his accepted scripture, rather than admit I was right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure we have all argued with people when we know we are right. Some people who just don&rsquo;t want to admit the truth will deny everything except for what is consistent with their beliefs. These same people debate not for gaining knowledge, but for the sake of argument. They just don&rsquo;t want to believe, and at that point, nothing can change them except for themselves. One cannot offer a glass of water to someone who denies the existence of thirst.</p>

      <title>On Reading Philosophy</title>
      <link>https://hayaan.me/posts/0029/</link>

      <description>Everyone should do it.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Of all the classes that I have taken so far, Philosophy has had the largest impact on me. I took it earlier this year at <a href="https://foothill.edu">Foothill College</a> on a whim, and I am glad that I did.</p>
<p>First, there are the more straightforward benefits of the class. It was very writing-heavy, with a 900 word essay and two shorter 200 word responses due every week. The midterm exam was a 5 page paper, and the final was two 2 ½ page papers. My writing, especially about complex topics, increased as a result of the course.</p>
<p>Second, there are the philosophical benefits. I feel as if a whole field of knowledge has been opened to me. Before, epistemology, ontology, or ethics never even crossed my mind. Now, I can think about these topics critically and form my own opinions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, philosophical texts are incredibly dense and hard to read. They are definitely not your everyday novels. I admit, I have only ever finished a handful of philosophical books, choosing instead to read excerpts and essays. In this limited fashion, I have read Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, Kant, Sartre, and so on.</p>
<p>In my opinion, excerpts are an easy way to get into philosophy. They take what can sometimes be a 1000+ page tome, and give you a taste of a main argument for an idea. The textbook I used in my course was Cottingham&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Western+Philosophy%3A+An+Anthology%2C+2nd+Edition-p-9781405124775"><em>Western Philosophy: An Anthology</em></a>, which, as it says in the title, is an anthology of western philosophical texts. For someone getting into philosophy, this is an easy way to get your foot in the door.</p>
<p>I highly recommend everyone read philosophy and not be discouraged by the difficult nature of writings in the field. No one is expecting you to takle Kant as your first read; instead, you can get a quick overview of major philosophical texts by reading an anthology of excerpts.</p>

      <title>Finding Balance on The Road</title>

      <description>We are all carrying the fire.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>What&rsquo;s the bravest thing you ever did? He spat in the road a bloody phlegm. Getting up this morning, he said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yesterday I finished <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road"><em>The Road</em></a> by Cormac McCarthy. I usually don&rsquo;t read contemporary literature, but I stumbled on this book in a Reddit thread about emotional books, and decided to give it a shot. It was published in 2006, and I feel that it was a breath of fresh air given that I mostly read 19th-century Russian novels.</p>
<p>The book describes the journey of a father and son in a post-apocalyptic landscape decimated by an unspecified cataclysm. There are many themes in the book, but I would like to focus on reason vs. emotion in this post.</p>
<p>The father is far from optimistic. Numerous times throughout the plot, the son asks his father if there are other good people still alive somewhere, like Mars. The father makes no delay in shutting this optimism down, saying that it&rsquo;s impossible for humans to survive on other planets.</p>
<p>Instead, he is focused on survival in a completely rational way. He doesn&rsquo;t let emotion cloud his judgement. The boy falters in fear when entering an abandoned house, but the father goes in knowing they must find food or die.</p>
<p>However, the end reveals that it is a mix of rationality and emotion that helps you achieve salvation. The boy&rsquo;s life is saved after the father&rsquo;s death only because he emotionally trusted a random stranger. Similarly, the father and son have only survived this long because the father put logic first.</p>
<p>This shows that it is important to strike a balance in our life. Going full on Rousseau is not the right decision, nor is going full on Enlightenment. It is in the middle that we can best live our lives.</p>

      <description>Choose people over profits.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m trying to watch less of what YouTube recommends, but it sometimes shows me an incredible piece of media. I got recommended this video today:</p>
<p>
<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tSC06P9A5W4" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>
 <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you are familiar with the printer-ink pricing model. Sell the printer for cheap, sometimes even at a loss, and recoup all your money and more by selling ink at incredibly high prices in perpetuity. No one likes it, except for the companies selling the ink.</p>
<p>Danaher, a company that owns many biotech companies, loves this model. Their daughter company Cepheid makes an amazing and reasonably priced tuberculosis test machine that gives fast results without an expensive lab, which should make testing more accessible in low-income countries. Except for the fact that they mark up the actual tests by 300-500%, overcharging the people who can least afford it.</p>
<p>This is not okay. Over 40% of TB cases go undiagnosed, and Danaher could save hundreds of thousands of lives if they drop the price of tests down to $5, a price that is low but still allows them to turn a profit. Right now, the tests are $10-$15, the same as the weekly median salary in TB-ridden Sierra Leone.</p>
<p>This is not okay. People who need these tests the most pay too often with their lives. <a href="https://tbfighters.org/">Danaher, it&rsquo;s time for $5</a>.</p>

      <description>The next burning of the Library of Alexandria.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I few days ago I <a href="../0021/">wrote</a> about how corporations are centralizing their power online in their endless pursuit of profits. <a href="https://michal.sapka.me/2023/reddit-and-the-centralized-web/">This post</a> by Michał Sapke goes along the same lines, but looks at it from the perspective of lost knowledge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Somehow, silently Reddit has eaten the Web. What will happen when Reddit shuts down? It will, eventually. It’s a company, and those are not everlasting. And with that, we will lose a significant part of the knowledge on the Internet.</p>
<p>What will happen when Wikipedia shuts down?</p>
<p>What will happen when Youtube shuts down?</p>
<p>When a blog or a forum shuts down, we lose its content, but not much is actually lost. For sure, someone has written the same or asked the same question. It may have been the best article about a given subject, but it’s not the only one. With the ubiquitous nature of Reddit or Wikipedia, people don’t duplicate the knowledge. Instead, just point to Reddit. Do we have an alternative to the bigger subreddits? How often a response is just a link to a Reddit thread?</p>
<p>And what if the answer lives in a closed Discord server? Discordization of the Web is what we see now. All this knowledge is not publicly available.</p>
<p>What we see now is just a taste of the Web corporations want. And this will lead to the next burning of the Library of Alexandria.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m pessimistic about the future of knowledge on the Web. In the past, I would have said that we would always have the Internet Archive when Reddit shuts down, but that organization has <a href="https://time.com/6266147/internet-archive-copyright-infringement-books-lawsuit/">recently come under attack</a>. Now, I don&rsquo;t know how we move forward. Downloading Reddit is not an option now that the API is restricted.</p>
<p>Something big needs to change. I hope it does.</p>

      <description>Or is it already too late?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Left and the Right are always arguing over climate change. More specifically, they are hung up on whether or not the warming up of the planet&rsquo;s climate is man-made. This question was even asked in the Republican Presidential Debate a week or so ago.</p>
<p>Personally, I don&rsquo;t see why this question is pertinent. Who cares if we caused Earth to heat up or not. This is a rare case where we need to fight the symptom, not the cause. We all know that the climate is changing and the world is getting hotter. The real question we need to be asking is: can we stop it?</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, it will be incredibly difficult. The following chart depicts the projected temperature increase over the next century. If you follow the blue line, you can see that if we stop all carbon dioxide production in 2050, temperatures will still be higher than they are now.</p>

<p>This is why I am incredibly pessimistic about the future of the planet&rsquo;s climate. I sincerly hope that these predictions are wrong. But for now, it seems like climate change is something unchangeable—its here to stay.</p>

      <title>End-to-End Encryption is Not Secure</title>
      <link>https://hayaan.me/posts/0024/</link>

      <description>It&amp;#39;s just another buzzword.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have all heard the classic tech buzzwords: artificial intelligence, machine learning, military-grade encryption, and countless others. This last one is particularly annoying because all it means is <code>AES256</code>, the bare minimum for a modern application. In recent years, the general public has begun to understand that military-grade encryption is just corporate-speak and nothing special. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the term &ldquo;end-to-end encryption.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Encryption is good, don&rsquo;t get me wrong. In messaging applications its a requirement. But encryption means nothing when the company running the messaging application has the encryption keys. For example, <em>WhatsApp</em> encrypts messages when you send them, then <em>WhatsApp</em> decrypts them on the recipient&rsquo;s device. WhatsApp handles all the encryption, so they can read your messages, despite what they claim.</p>
<p>This is the reason that most end-to-end encryption is not secure. Most applications that implement it don&rsquo;t put the keys in the user&rsquo;s hands, but keep them themselves. The way to tell if a company has done it properly is if you must generate keys on your own computer, then share them with the recipient, and vice-versa. Github is a good example of this. To sign commits, the user needs to generate their own OpenGPG key. This is the way to do it.</p>
<p>I understand that an app like WhatsApp can&rsquo;t realistically have every user generate their own encryption keys. What they can do, however, is stop advertising &ldquo;end-to-end encryption&rdquo; like it&rsquo;s anything secure.</p>

      <title>Privacy with the Google Nest Hub</title>

      <description>I&amp;#39;m on the fence about keeping it.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have slowly been removing more and more Google products from my life over concerns about their privacy, or lack thereof. I switched to DuckDuckGo, left Chrome for Firefox, and so on. So, like the inconsistent wreck I am, I have gotten my hands on a Google Nest Hub that I promptly set up on my bedside table.</p>
<p>Like any Google product, its filled with blatant grabs for my data in the name of improving the company&rsquo;s products and services. I have said no to everything I can, but still I&rsquo;m uneasy about keeping it. It&rsquo;s a substantial upgrade over my previous alarm clock, given that it can set multiple alarms (the main feature I need) and also has all the Google Assistant stuff. However, there is something that erks me about keeping a motion sensor and microphone pointed at me all night, especially when all that data is going straight to Google&rsquo;s servers.</p>
<p>I would feel much better about this if the data stayed on my device. But Google sends so many data points to their servers that really doesn&rsquo;t need to be there. One can&rsquo;t even ask Google Assistant for the time without being connected to the internet.</p>
<p>In the end, I&rsquo;m on the fence about keeping it. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, it&rsquo;s an amazing product, but I am bothered by having a smart display run by Google, of all companies.</p>

      <title>Setting Up a Custom Domain</title>

      <description>It&amp;#39;s important for the longevity of the web.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Using a custom domain on your website is great for all the obvious reasons. It forms a brand identity, keeps your site memorable, and looks much better than <code>username.github.io</code>, for example.</p>
<p>But, it&rsquo;s important for another reason: longevity. No web server is forever. Your website <strong>will</strong> die some day in the future in an irrecoverable way. When that happens, you will be forced to transfer it to a new server. If you don&rsquo;t own your domain, all the links to your content that you have accumulated throughout the years will die with your old server. With a custom domain, maintaining hyperlinks in the event of a catastrophic faliure is as simple as editing a couple lines of text.</p>
<p>It is for this reason that I have finally purchased a custom domain for this blog: <a href="https://hayaan.me/">https://hayaan.me/</a>. I hope you will too for your site.</p>
<p>P.S. Domain records are <em>way</em> more complicated and slow than they ought to be.</p>

      <title>Centralization of Power</title>
      <link>https://hayaan.me/posts/0021/</link>

      <description>Power-hungry execs are destroying the Web.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the long-ago, email was created to allow easy communication over the Internet. I don&rsquo;t know if you have ever noticed, but email is completely decentralized—a buzzword usually reserved for Web3 startups promising to reform crypto. But in all seriousness, this decentralized nature is why email is so ubiquitous today. Imagine if a hotmail user couldn&rsquo;t email a gmail user: that would be horrible! Because it&rsquo;s open source and decentralized, anyone can create a email server and send email to any other email server. Furthermore, anyone can use any email client to access their email.</p>
<p>This is in stark contrast to the social media platforms of today. Twitter is locked down. Reddit is locked down. Facebook. Instagram. WhatsApp. The list is so long I would probably break the upload limit on my WiFi if I tried to post it all.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, a photo I post on Instagram would show up on Twitter, Reddit, and the like. Any replies on any of the platforms would seamlessly show up on the others. Exactly how email works today between different email apps and services. So why don&rsquo;t all these modern social media platforms talk to each other?</p>
<p>I think its because executives at these companies are trying to centralize their power to make a little extra cash. The centralization of power is something we are witnessing more and more in the corporate world. For example, Twitter and Reddit recently closed down their APIs to third-parties (where they couldn&rsquo;t show advertisements), set vague rules, and forced users who didn&rsquo;t comply out of the platform. Companies don&rsquo;t want to share because that doesn&rsquo;t promote their bottom line.</p>
<p>Centralization of power, like most things, has pros and cons. I&rsquo;m not here to preach about when it is appropriate and when not. However, I can say that consolidating power in a single entity is often to the detriment of massive portions of the user base.</p>
<p>The Internet would be a less hostile, open place if platforms could talk to each other like email services do.</p>

      <title>Using the Right Tool for the Job</title>
      <link>https://hayaan.me/posts/0020/</link>

      <description>Things are much easier that way.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A year or so ago, I learned the Rust<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> programming language. Since its first stable release in 2015, it has quickly developed a hold on the world of systems programming. It is well loved because it enforces memory safety, something many existing systems languages, like C, do not.</p>
<p>Rust was designed from the ground up to be a <em>systems</em> programming language, used to build performance-critical software like operating systems and embedded applications. But then people go and try to build websites with it. I admit, I <a href="https://github.com/omega1510/webassembly">am</a> <a href="https://github.com/omega1510/todo">guilty</a> of this, too.</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/qc">

         alt="Part of a comic from SMBC."/> </a><figcaption>
            <p>Part of a comic from <a href="https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/qc">SMBC</a>.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>What I have learned, though, is that things are often easier when you use the right tool for the job. As much as I hate javascript, I will still use it if I need to build a website. And as much as I love Rust, I will come running back Python for any data manipulation.</p>
<p>Picking the right tool from the outset saves you from <em>so</em> much frustration. For example, I have sunk countless hours into modifying and customizing my macOS system, something it is clearly not meant to allow. I have also put in large amounts of effort to try and get Windows games running on other operating systems. I could have avoided stress and frustration if I had customized Linux instead and ran Windows to play games.</p>
<p>Making something do a thing it wasn&rsquo;t meant to do is akin to taking an exam with a piece of charcoal instead of a pencil. Sure, it works in theory, but it&rsquo;s so stupid no one would actually do it. But when it comes to software, everyone suddenly calls it innovation, not stupidity.</p>

      <title>RSS and Algorithms</title>

      <description>How to limit algorithms&amp;#39; control on you.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In &ldquo;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-ai-scary-robots-already-control-you-muhammad-hadi-yusufali">Why is AI Scary? Robots Already Control You,</a>&rdquo; M. Hadi writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The robots have been taking over for years now.</p>
<p>Now, when we open our phone, we literally open our mouths to the hundreds upon thousands of algorithms, waiting to be fed by them. We stare at our home screen, waiting for new notifications to pop up before tapping them at superhuman speed. The concerning part is not that we&rsquo;re seeing what other people have messaged us, or catching up on what&rsquo;s happening in the world—it&rsquo;s that most of the time, we&rsquo;re not consciously making the decision to do so. We&rsquo;re just letting these algorthims, these AIs, detect what happens next in our lives.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve gotten used to it. We open ourselves up to YouTube, to TikTok, to Instagram, just going on those sites or apps whenever we want a &ldquo;break&rdquo;—just being fed more and more content. This &ldquo;break&rdquo; is nothing more than us wanting to stop controlling ourselves, wanting to be controlled by others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is why I love RSS. No multi-national <del>devils</del> corporations, no algorithms, no artificial intelligence—just control. RSS is a technology that lets you view posts from many different websites as a feed. For example, if I really like a blog, I will add it to my RSS aggregator. If I start to dislike a blog, I can just remove it. No algorithms serving me content to control me and maximize my watch time. I have full control.</p>
<p>One thing I find particularly dangerous with algorithms is news websites. They try to serve you headlines that incite an emotional response, not ones that give you an actual overview of the news. This way, they can have a massive influence on what the public believes. It is a modern-day version of the content censorship that was widespread in totalitarian governments, like the Soviet Union. Using RSS is especially important in this case.</p>
<p>I think everyone should use RSS wherever they can to limit the control AI has on them.</p>

      <title>A Look at the Gulag with Ivan Denisovich</title>
      <link>https://hayaan.me/posts/0018/</link>

      <description>Time to yell at Stalin.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>During his years in prisons and in camps he’d lost the habit of planning for the next day, for a year ahead, for supporting his family. The authorities did his thinking for him about everything—it was somehow easier that way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I just finished reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_in_the_Life_of_Ivan_Denisovich"><em>One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich</em></a>, so it&rsquo;s time for me to have a good yell at the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>But first, some background about the book. It&rsquo;s author, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Solzhenitsyn">Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn</a>, was imprisoned in the Soviet Union&rsquo;s harsh Gulag work camp system under Stalin from 1945 to 1953. After his release, Solzhenitsyn began writing <em>One Day</em>, a narrative of life in the Gulag. The book helped spark a wave of anti-Soviet sentiment after its publication.</p>
<p>I am almost struggling to give a consice overview of the Gulag&rsquo;s psychological horror outlined in this novel. It is so dense and multifaceted that no short post like this can do it justice. Whenever you think that Solzhenitsyn has covered all the atrocities of the labor camps, the book hits you with another way the Gulag tries to break its prisoners. Does the horror stop at physical work? No, there are no fixed wages and another person screwing up means no one gets any money. Does it stop there? No, corruption in the Gulag&rsquo;s administration means you can&rsquo;t file complaints either. Does it stop there? Absolutely not.</p>
<p>I am so upset that people were abused to the point that they must lick other people&rsquo;s bowls of soup clean to get enough nutrition. And camps like this aren&rsquo;t a relic of the past; they still exist in places like China and Burma.</p>
<p>The novel is still very much applicable to us in the current era. It continues to show us the depths of the human soul through the eyes of prisoners in the Gulag.</p>

      <title>Evil and an Omnipotent God</title>
      <link>https://hayaan.me/posts/0017/</link>

      <description>How can evil exist when God is good?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This post is an addendum to <a href="../0016">yesterday&rsquo;s post</a> about Thomas Aquinas&rsquo;s five ways to argue for the existence of God. In the same book where his arguments were published, the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm#article3">Summa Theologica</a>, the Catholic philosopher addressed a possible objection to the omnipotence of God.</p>
<p>He begins by describing the objection:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It seems that God does not exist; because if one of two contraries be infinite, the other would be altogether destroyed. But the word &ldquo;God&rdquo; means that He is infinite goodness. If, therefore, God existed, there would be no evil discoverable; but there is evil in the world. Therefore God does not exist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What does Aquinas mean by this? He first states a premise that two infinite things—good and evil in the passage—cannot both exist together. If either one is infinite, then it must overpower the other. For example, a world with an infinite source of good cannot contain any evil. Furthermore, if God exists, then He must be infinitely good, and His goodness must overpower all evil in the universe. However, there is clearly evil present in the world we live in. Therefore God, or at least an omnipotent one, cannot exist our universe.</p>
<p>On the surface, this objection seems convincing. It strikes an emotional chord with most people, who have been through calamities in their lives and often questioned the supremacy of God thereafter. The objection is a variation of the classic question: &ldquo;why do bad things happen to good people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aquinas addresses this remonstration by citing Augustine of Hippo, a bishop who defended Christianity against philosophical attacks in his writings. Augustine argues that God&rsquo;s power is so great that He would not allow evil to exist unless he could bring good out of evil; therefore, even a universe with evil in it can contain an infinitely good God because all evil actions have the potential for good.</p>
<p>As Aquinas puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is part of the infinite goodness [and mercy] of God, that He should allow evil to exist, and out of it produce good.</p>
</blockquote>

      <title>Aquinas&#39; Quinque Viae</title>

      <description>A Catholic philosopher&amp;#39;s proofs for the existence of God.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The existence of God has been a point of contention among philosophers for as long as philosophy has existed. Even Socrates called into question the supremacy of the ancient Greek gods in his home of Athens nearly half a millenium prior to the birth of Christ. Still today, theists are engaged in vigorous debate with modern philosophers over rational evidence for God&rsquo;s existence.</p>
<p>In the mid-13th century, Catholic philosopher Thomas Aquinas composed his magnum opus, the <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/17611/pg17611.html"><em>Summa Theologica</em></a>, a religious textbook for students beginning their studies in theology. He recognized the necessity of proving God&rsquo;s existence in his work, and wrote the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm#article3">Quinque Viae</a>: five ways to argue that God does indeed exist.</p>
<p>Aquinas' arguments are admittedly weak when exposed to modern scrutiny, but they provide a basis for many modern arguments favoring God. They are heavily cited, &ldquo;classic&rdquo; theological arguments, not necessarily fool-proof ones. Nevertheless, they create an excellent baseline on which to form a complete understanding of God&rsquo;s existence.</p>
<h2 id="the-argument-of-the-unmoved-mover">The Argument of the Unmoved Mover</h2>
<p>In the world we live in, everything is in motion. But for something to be in motion, it must have been moved by something else. For example, if I push a block of wood, a chemical imbalance in my muscles acted a force on the block. The chemical imbalance also itself was caused by electrical impulses in my nerves, which in turn were caused by something else.</p>
<p>This chain cannot be infinitely long; it therefore follows that there must have been a first mover in the beginning who, while unmoved, exerted a force on the universe. This primeval entity is understood to be God.</p>
<h2 id="the-argument-of-the-first-cause">The Argument of the First Cause</h2>
<p>We live in a world of cause and effect. Things are caused by other things. It is not possible for a thing to cause itself, so it must have been caused by another distinct event. This second event is itself the effect of another cause, and so on. For example, a plant grows because of sunlight, which exists because of the sun, which exists because of gravity.</p>
<p>Like in the first argument, this chain cannot continue ad infinitum. A first cause must exist that began the chain but was not caused itself. This cause is God.</p>
<h2 id="the-argument-from-contingency">The Argument from Contingency</h2>
<p>Things can be broadly divided into two groups: the possible and the necessary. Possible things are those that have the ability to not exist. For example, cats are possible entities because they live and die, and if you go back far enough in time, no cats existed.</p>
<p>For every possible thing, there is a time in the past when it did not exist. If everything is possible, then there must exist a time long in the past when nothing existed at all. If this is the case, then nothing could exist now, because nothing can come into existence except through a being that already exists.</p>
<p>Therefore, it follows that a necessary being—something that <em>must</em> exist and cannot be nonexistent—existed in the beginning. Everything that exists draws its existence back to it. This necessary being is God.</p>
<h2 id="the-argument-from-degree">The Argument from Degree</h2>
<p>All things vary in their imitation of the True, the Good, and the Beautiful. Some entities imitate at a higher degree, and are subsequently considered better. For example, in a room of people, there is always a tallest.</p>
<p>Something must exist that is the most True, Good, and Beautiful—the &ldquo;tallest&rdquo; of all existence, so to speak. Furthermore, the most perfect in any group is the cause of all qualities of that group, like how fire, the pinnacle of heat, is the cause of all hot things. There must be a being to which all truth, nobility, and beauty is devoted—a being perfect in every way. This being we call God.</p>
<h2 id="the-argument-from-final-cause">The Argument from Final Cause</h2>
<p>Inanimate objects in the world behave in regular and predictable ways. If their design was based purely on chance, then their behavior would not be predictable. For these inanimate objects, which lack intelligence, the fact that they move toward the same purpose means they must have been directed by something else with intelligence and influence.</p>
<p>Therefore, a being must exist that is the source of all common purpose in the governance of the world. God is this being.</p>
<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>I find myself agreeing with much of what Aquinas has to say. His simple language and illustrative examples helped me refine the thoughts floating around my head. I am sure we have all heard the Argument of the Unmoved Mover and Argument from Final Cause before, but to read it from the source is an enlightening experience.</p>
<p>Modern philosophy has not failed to uncover fallacies in Aquinas' arguments; in addition, his writings leave a distinctly Platonic/Aristotelian aftertaste in my mouth. But there is something endearing about Aquinas' attempt at distilling things I have heard for years into concrete philosophical statements. There is undoubtedly a reason why Aquinas is so commonly referenced in philosophy courses: he took a concept as perfect as God and made it comprehensible by the imperfect human cognition.</p>

      <title>Outsourcing Thinking with Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://hayaan.me/posts/0015/</link>

      <description>ChatGPT thinks so we don&amp;#39;t have to.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have no doubt that artifical intelligence is the next breakthrough technology. I am sure that you have seen the myriad of startups sticking machine learning into places it shouldn&rsquo;t go. Already generative AI has reformed the education space, forcing teachers and schools to adapt or fall behind.</p>
<p>Like every breakthrough technology, research in the field follows a sigmoid curve. It starts out slow, then it feels like everything is using it all of a sudden, then it flattens out as innovation hits a plateau. With AI, it is impossible to tell where we are on that curve. I sincerely hope that we are nearing the end, that this technology has hit its limit and cannot improve any more.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/posts/0015/sigmoid.svg" type="" alt="A sigmoid curve."  /></p>
<p>Why do I feel this way? A scary pattern emerges when we look at the consequences of widespread adoption of previous breakthrough technologies. When the camera came along, we could offload our responsibility to remember the events in our life to the camera. No longer did we have to fill our brains with information about our experiences; we could rely on a photograph instead. The result: our memories of an object <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797613504438">are limited</a> when we take a photo of that object.</p>
<p>I fear that if we begin outsourcing all our thinking to artifical intelligence, we will lose the ability to think. In my view, the ability to think critically is humanity&rsquo;s greatest strength. If we rely on generative AI to draw connections and link ideas, we <strong>will</strong> forget how to do it ourselves. And that scares me.</p>
<p>I am reminded of H. G. Wells' 1895 novella <em>The Time Machine</em>. In it, the upper class of humanity has slowly made its life easier and easier through manipulation of its environment and of the workers beneath it. With no problems to solve, these future humans have devolved into animals with no ability to think. The workers, who have always relied on themselves to get by, become the new ruling class.</p>
<p>I hope that artificial intelligence has peaked. If it hasn&rsquo;t, it will come to destroy us, slowly boiling us like frogs.</p>

      <description>A rant about making money following my passion.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am starting to apply to colleges, and beginning that process involves first choosing what major to study. I love biology and chemistry, so I am naturally inclined to choose biochemistry. However, there are a number of issues that prevent me from pursuing what I would love to do in the future.</p>
<p>First, if I am to major in biochemistry, I am more-or-less forced to pursue a doctoral degree. To quit my education with just a Bachelor&rsquo;s would be to condemn myself to a poor job outlook. Most companies in biotech are looking for candidates with a Ph.D. or M.D., and jobs for recent graduates with just a Bachelor&rsquo;s are few and far between, often with disappointing salaries.</p>
<p>Second, I do not want to be a physician, and there aren&rsquo;t many options for lucrative careers in biology that do not involve practicing medicine. I would love to research and teach, not work with patients. The classic path for doing research is a Ph.D., but putting in nearly a decade of work to make less than what a doctor does doesn&rsquo;t sound appealing to me.</p>
<p>The only upside to doing a Ph.D. that I can see is the lower cost. People regularly leave medical school with half a million dollars in student debt. In contrast, doctoral students usually get a stipend from the lab they work at which mostly covers the cost of the program, and they can teach a little bit to make up the difference in cash.</p>
<p>I would love to do a Ph.D. and have great job prospects afterwards that are not limited to academia. It would be great to do research in a lab somewhere and live a life where I am doing what I love. Unfortunatly, in the current education landscape, that does not seem to be possible. For now, I plan to apply as a biochemistry major and complete my undergraduate degree. Then I will see what the future holds.</p>

      <title>Lessons from The Old Man and the Sea</title>

      <description>Simple writing conveying deep meaning.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;But man is not made for defeat,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A man can be destroyed but not defeated.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus states the old man in Ernest Hemingway&rsquo;s timeless novel, <em>The Old Man and the Sea.</em> I recently finished this book, which was one of the best novels I have read in the past few months. In it, Hemingway uses incredibly simple language to craft a beautiful plot of willpower and determination. The book features an old fisherman who goes out to sea further than he has ever gone, and ends up catching a fish weighing over a thousand pounds.</p>
<p>Through the book&rsquo;s protagonist, Hemingway symbolizes the peak of manhood: an unwavering—and sometimes detrimental—resolve to achieve a goal. Hemingway shows that it is not raw power or an aggressive personality that makes a man; rather, it is determination in the face of certain defeat that really matters. In other words, manliness is the ability to always rise from defeat.</p>
<p>I planned to list out some of the specific lessons and symbolism in <em>The Old Man and the Sea</em>. However, this article does it much better than I can: <a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/manly-lessons/lessons-in-manliness-from-the-old-man-and-the-sea/">Lessons in Manliness from The Old Man and the Sea</a>. I highly recommend everyone read it after they have read Hemingway&rsquo;s original novel.</p>
<p>I think that it is to every man&rsquo;s advantage to read <em>The Old Man and the Sea</em>. It&rsquo;s a short novel, too; it comes in around 100 pages, and its simple language means anyone can easily benefit.</p>

      <description>Social media is dying.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&rsquo;t have any social media. I never have. But every day I am swarmed with signals from the top platforms on the web to JOIN JOIN JOIN! And when the signals aren&rsquo;t directly from them, they are from friends and family, who subtly give me funny looks when I tell them that I don&rsquo;t have an Instagram.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I nearly made a Mastodon account. <em>Nearly.</em> While Mastodon is great as far as social media platforms go, it is still fundamentaly a breed of app I don&rsquo;t want anything to do with.</p>
<p>Manuel Moreale <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/places-on-the-web">wrote</a> yesterday:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Big social media platforms are the metropolis: dense, busy, chaotic. They’re the place that never sleeps and there’s always something new going on.<br>
&hellip;<br>
There was a time when forums were the cities of the web but now are more like small towns. They’re the place where people congregate around shared interests.<br>
&hellip;<br>
And then there’re personal sites, the house in the forest. It’s the place people escape to when they’re tired of the noise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Big social media platforms have gone from cities upon a hill to something that resembles today&rsquo;s San Francisco: dirty, crime-ridden, and dying. I think I&rsquo;ll stick to my house in the forest, even if nobody is here with me.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you open my website&rsquo;s <a href="https://omega1510.github.io/robots.txt">robots.txt</a>, you will see that it includes the following lines:</p>

</div>
</div><p>What do these lines of code do? Well, they stop OpenAI&rsquo;s ChatGPT from learning from my blog.</p>
<p>OpenAI recently unveiled GPTBot, a piece of software that lets them harvest data from the web to train their artificial intelligence models on. If you take issue with that, like I do, then adding those lines to your website prevent it from scraping the content you wrote.</p>
<p>I, and many other people, don&rsquo;t want artifical intelligence benefiting from my blood, sweat, and tears for free. I find it deplorable that you must &ldquo;opt-out&rdquo; of this process. What about people who have no idea that their data is being harvested and used, or who aren&rsquo;t technically inclined enough to block GPTBot? Will their data be used without compensation until the end of time?</p>
<p>The way it should work is that you must opt-in specifically, and only then will OpenAI scrape your website. Unfortunately, we all know this won&rsquo;t happen. All OpenAI cares about is profit, and that won&rsquo;t happen if they actually respect people&rsquo;s basic right to privacy.</p>
<p>I recently talked about this with a friend. He told me that AI is the future of using the web, and if I block ChatGPT, I&rsquo;m going to lose out on a lot of readers. My opinion may change in the future, but as of now, so be it.</p>

      <description>The beginning of the end.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My senior year of high school started on Monday. I am expecting a brutal few months, filled with countlessly revising long college essays in the hopes of gaining admission somewhere I won&rsquo;t totally hate.</p>
<p>It is not all bad, though. I really only have three difficult classes: Honors English, AP Psychology, and AP Macroeconomics. I may decide to self-study AP Literature, but I don&rsquo;t know yet.</p>
<p>The school is also giving us Tuesdays and Thursdays off, and Fridays are half-days, so every week is more-or-less an easy week. And there is a big international trip in December I am looking forward to.</p>
<p>As to how this development relates to the blog, I&rsquo;m not sure. I may not write as much if I am overburdened with work during the school year. Or, I may write a lot now that I have another source of stimuli and reflection in my life. Who knows?</p>

      <title>On Sleep</title>

      <description>I really need more of it...</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>It is He who made the night a garment for you, and sleep a rest, and made the day like a resurrection. (Quran 25:47)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>School has started up again this week. On the second day of English class, the teacher showed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MuIMqhT8DM">this Ted Talk</a> about sleep to us. The video discussed the numerous consequenses of not getting a good night&rsquo;s sleep. The ones that stood out most to me were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lowered intelligence by 40%</li>
<li>Inability to commit events to long-term memory</li>
<li>Increase in rates of car accidents and heart attacks</li>
<li>Promotion of cancer and harm to the immune system</li>
</ul>
<p>I really need to start focusing on my sleep. My nighttime routine involves washing up, praying, and reading a book before slowly drifting to sleep. Some nights, I don&rsquo;t fall asleep until 1am. I will just lie there with my eyes open for an hour and half, blink, and wake up five hours later.</p>
<p>The most simple improvement is just going to bed earlier. Reading action-packed novels can keep my mind awake long after I put the book down, so avoiding these types of books when I am winding down is also key.</p>
<p>Here is the video. I encourage everyone to watch it.</p>

      <title>Operating Systems Are Bloated</title>
      <link>https://hayaan.me/posts/0008/</link>

      <description>There are so many apps included, and you have to use them.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been using Pop_OS!, a popular Linux distribution, on my laptop for years. Recently, I also switched my old desktop over to the lightweight operating system. When people argue over what system is the best, they often only consider macOS or Windows. However, a user of either system will not consider where both fail because they have never experienced what they could have had. Because I use neither, I think I can provide a unique perspective on the shortcomings of both options.</p>
<p>I first had the idea to write about this when I replaced the Gnome desktop environment that came default with Pop_OS! with another piece of software called i3. It was a much better experience, and I wondered why other people do not make similar modifications to their computers. I soon realized, however, that modifications like this are not even possible when you are using a more conventional operating system.</p>
<p>Historically, operating systems did what they said on the can: operate the system. They allowed applications, which were defined by the user, to communicate with the computer&rsquo;s hardware, and vice-versa.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/posts/0008/operating-system.svg" type="" alt="The historical role of operating systems."  /></p>
<p>But now, operating systems have gone from being a simple interface between applications and hardware to all-powerful processes demanding the user&rsquo;s complete submission. Gone are the days of choosing what your computer runs; operating systems provide default apps, and you <strong>must</strong> use them.</p>
<p>Many points of contention in the &ldquo;what OS is best&rdquo; debate arise from the operating system making decisions for you and not letting you change its choice. For example, people argue over the placement of buttons on either the top-left or top-right corner. macOS has gone with the former option, while Windows chooses the latter. But this decision should never have been the OS&rsquo;s to make! This decision has always been made by the user when they installed a desktop environment; who let Apple or Microsoft choose?</p>
<p>To illustrate again: Microsoft recently rounded the corners of windows in a visual revamp of their operating system. Historically, this has been an option in applications called compositors, which the user could choose to install. If they weren&rsquo;t satisfied with one, they could choose another. By rounding corners of windows with no way to undo it, Microsoft made a decision that the user had the right to make.</p>
<p>I suppose that Apple and Microsoft are doing this in the name of &ldquo;crafting an experience.&rdquo; I have nothing against that. In fact, I applaud them for taking the time to create great applications, like desktop environments, window managers, and compositors, and including them with their operating systems. I take issue with the fact that they have stolen the user&rsquo;s ability to switch to another application they find better.</p>
<p>Both tech giants already include apps that fit this philosophy. Apple provides Disk Utility on their computers, a great app to format and manage storage drives on your computer. They also don&rsquo;t force you to use it, letting you install other drive-managing software. If they took this stance with other parts of their operating systems, it would be better for everyone. Regular users would get their default apps and experience, while advanced ones could install they apps they want installed.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I&rsquo;ll stick with Linux, where I can choose exactly what code my CPU is crunching through.</p>

      <title>Watches Aren&#39;t Investments</title>
      <link>https://hayaan.me/posts/0007/</link>

      <description>They are emotional purchases, not rational ones.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the owner of a <em>very</em> small and cheap watch collection, I am in no way qualified to comment on the practice of buying luxury watches as investment opportunities. My most expensive watch does not even crack four figures, and none of the pieces in my collection are likely to provide me a return-on-investment.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Still—whether out of spite or because I have no stake in the result, I don&rsquo;t know—I am going to write out my opinion on the matter.</p>
<p>An argument can be made that watches are great investments. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-16/luxury-swiss-watches-still-beat-stocks-and-crypto-despite-rolex-and-patek-drop">According to Bloomberg</a>, luxury Swiss watches have consistently beat stocks and crypto over the past few years. I am bombarded with videos of millionaire watch salesmen preaching the benefits of buying a $50,000 Patek Phillipe.</p>
<p>However, this betrays the real reason people should be buying watches. Many decades ago, watches were tools; now, they are jewelry. Nonetheless, like all tools or jewelry, watches are meant to be <em>worn</em>, not locked up in a safety deposit box. Yes, every dent on the case and scratch on the crystal drains value, but it adds character.</p>
<p>And watches aren&rsquo;t meant to be investments, either. If someone had cash to burn and wanted to grow it, they would invest in something much more lucrative. We buy watches because we <em>like</em> them; it is a deeply emotional purchase. I think we are too fed up with how it holds value or how it looks on our wrist, not about how much we like it. To reduce something so beautiful, with such intricate engineering, to just an investment is a disservice to the world of horology.</p>

      <title>Condemned to Be Free</title>
      <link>https://hayaan.me/posts/0006/</link>

      <description>Do humans have free will?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This essay was submitted in partial fulfillment of an Intro to Philosophy course at <a href="https://www.foothill.edu/">Foothill College</a>.</em></p>
<p>For centuries, philosophers have debated what free will is and whether we even possess it. In an increasingly scientific world, some of them argue that our choices are determined only by the laws of physics. In contrast, others believe that free will is an essential component of human nature. Although the universe appears to operate in a deterministic way, the idea of free will is instrumental in our moral accountability and individual identity.</p>
<p>One thing that separates us as humans from animals is that we take responsibility for our actions. An animal acts purely based on its desires; a lion cannot be held accountable for killing a gazelle. On the other hand, humans can be punished for their unjust acts. This innate responsibility and accountability follows from the belief that humans have free will, that we choose to transgress. We must be responsible for our actions if there were alternate actions we could have taken. In a debate with English philosopher Thomas Hobbes, Dr. John Bramhall argued exactly this. He stated: “No man blames fire for burning whole cities; no man taxes poison for destroying men; but [he only blames] those persons who apply them to such wicked ends. If the will of man be not in his own disposition, he is no more a free agent than the fire or the poison.” Our world is built on the punishment of immoral actions. In many cases, a man only acts good because he is required to do so. If there was no free will, he could not be held accountable for his actions and all punishments would be baseless.</p>
<p>In addition to moral accountability, the idea of free will is also essential in our sense of personal identity. In his book <em>Being and Nothingness</em>, French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre suggests that our choices define who we are, and that without the ability to make choices, we would be nothing more than objects in the world. Sartre believes that humans have the ability to transcend their circumstances, “project forward”, and make choices that create their own identities. He argues that when we make a moral decision, we are not just choosing between different options—we are also choosing what kind of person we want to be. For example, when we choose to tell the truth instead of lying, we are not just choosing the &ldquo;right&rdquo; action—we are also choosing to be a truthful person. Free will is necessary for this development of identity. A purely deterministic system would take this away.</p>
<p>Breakthroughs in science suggest that the universe is deterministic. Everything exists in the movement of invisible atoms. Our consciousness is just neurons firing inside our skulls. How can one be free to will in this situation? While it is true that the universe appears to operate in a deterministic way, this does not necessarily mean that free will is an illusion. St. Augustine of Hippo targets this idea in his book <em>The City of God</em>. In his writing, he takes the determinist universe to be like God, who “knows unchangeably all things which shall be.” Augustine argues that, even though there is a God who knows everything, we still have the ability to make and act on our choices. This is because our wills work in conjunction with the will of God to predetermine things. God&rsquo;s foreknowledge of future events is based on his infinite wisdom and understanding of human nature, rather than on any causal relationship between God&rsquo;s knowledge and human actions. Therefore, even if the universe operates deterministically, it is still possible that humans have free will because our wills are part of the determining process.</p>
<p>The debate about free will has been ongoing for centuries, with some philosophers arguing that our choices are determined by the laws of physics and others arguing that free will is an essential component of human nature. While breakthroughs in science suggest that the universe is deterministic, the idea of free will remains instrumental in our moral accountability and personal identity. Without free will, we would not be able to take responsibility for our actions, nor would we be able to define ourselves as individuals. Even the deterministic universe suggested by science remains compatible with free will. When considering all these factors, it becomes clear that humans, as Sartre puts it, are “condemned to be free.”</p>

      <title>Do Evil People Exist?</title>
      <link>https://hayaan.me/posts/0005/</link>

      <description>What does &amp;#34;evil&amp;#34; even mean?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This question was first asked to me nearly a decade ago by an elementary school teacher. It has stuck with me all these years because, as far as I can tell, it was my first introduction to the world of philosophy. When the teacher asked it to that group of young third-graders, no one could answer him. Now, I think I might have a response.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-an-evil-action">What is an Evil Action?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>An evil intention perverts the best actions, and makes them sins.<br>
— Joseph Addison</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To clear up any ambiguity, we need to determine what exactly makes an action evil. We may define it very broadly, such that an evil action is one where there is even a small amount of immorality present, regardless of the greater good. This would include the classical &ldquo;bad&rdquo; actions, like murder and lying, as well as immoral acts performed for a large benefit, as in the case of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem">trolley problem</a>. Nearly every action we perform could be considered evil under this definition. An action performed solely for our benefit could be considered selfish, and therefore evil, for example.</p>
<p>Instead, one may limit the broad definition of evil, stating that an evil action is any action where the bad in it outweighs the good. This definition necessarily encompasses all immoral acts while omitting ones performed for the greater good.</p>
<p>A second alternative is a strict definition, where an action must be completely morally wrong, without any shred of good, for it to be considered evil. With this view, we omit many actions that are technically wrong but that nobody would call &ldquo;evil,&rdquo; such as white lies, for even a white lie would be beneficial to someone. However, we also exclude nearly every immoral act because most of them contain at least a little good; they are, so to speak, for the lesser good, but still good nonetheless.</p>
<p>I find the second definition—the limited yet broad one—to be the most appealing. It leaves wiggle room for actions performed for the greater good but includes things we would normally consider evil, like homicide.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-an-evil-person">What is an Evil Person?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>To prefer evil to good is not in human nature; and when a man is compelled to choose one of two evils, no one will choose the greater when he might have the less.<br>
— Plato</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An evil person could be someone who simply performs bad actions, no matter how little. If we accept this definition, in combination with either broad definition of evil, to be evil is to be human because men are not angels: we always incline towards a little bit of sin as consequence of our free will.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>If we consider an evil person as someone who performs only evil and no good, we get nowhere. Even Hitler, who we can all agree is evil, still paid his officers' wages. He did not wake up every morning with <em>just</em> the intention to kill. If we take this approach, no one in the history of mankind has been evil.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the best definition of an evil person, as with the case of evil actions, is someone who performs more evil than they do good. With this definition and the medium definition of evil, all the classical &ldquo;evil&rdquo; figures—Stalin, Hitler, Mao—would all be considered evil.</p>
<p>The answer to the question &ldquo;Do evil people exist?&rdquo; depends on your definition of &ldquo;evil&rdquo; and &ldquo;evil person.&rdquo; It can be argued that everybody is evil, or nobody is evil, or that only a few bad figures are evil. It is a matter of nuance and personal preference, and there is no right answer.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, a U.S. District Judge <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/ai-generated-art-cannot-receive-copyrights-us-court-says-2023-08-21/">ruled</a> that images created solely by artifical intelligence without any human input cannot be copyrighted under U.S. copyright law. He stated that human authorship is a prerequisite for copyright, and simply owning the AI responsible for generating a work is not enough to give you authorship of its creation. I am very interested in seeing how this precedent plays out in court cases in the coming years.</p>
<p>In particular, the issue of how much editing a human needs to do to the generated content for it to be considered a derivative work is of paramount importance and interest. If you have ChatGPT write an article, but you make a website and post it online, is that enough &ldquo;modification&rdquo; for you to be given ownership over the work?<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> What if you perform minimal edits, like removing the [YOUR NAME] bits the AI sometimes outputs? Is that &ldquo;modification?&rdquo; SAG-AFTRA, the Hollywood writers union that is currently on strike over the use of AI in the industry, has a vested interest in not allowing copyrighting of works where even a little bit of generative AI was used.</p>
<p>AI is meant to be used like an assistant. So if you and your assistant work on something together, and your assistant releases it to the public domain, how much editing to you need to do for you to claw back ownership and copyright it?</p>
<p>I am going to be closely following developments in the realm of artificial intelligence and copyright; I find this field, filled with moral landmines and massive grey areas, to be fascinating.</p>

<p>By the way, absolutely no generative AI is used when writing for this blog. In fact, I barely use generative AI at all because I find its use to be morally questionable and intellectually debillitating. Sorry OpenAI, I prefer to think for myself.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

      <title>My Thoughts on The Double</title>
      <link>https://hayaan.me/posts/0003/</link>

      <description>It was a blood-curdling, psychological exploration of identity with an underwhelming plot.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>Sorrow is concealed in gilded palaces, and there’s no escaping it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Last night I finished reading <em>The Double: A Petersburg Poem</em>. It is the third of Dostoevsky&rsquo;s works that I have read. I am usually a huge fan of the author; my favorite book is <em>Crime and Punishment</em> and I also loved <em>Notes from the Underground</em>. I love the deep explorations of morality and psychology that are woven throughout his books. His dialogue is unlike anything else that I have read: it is so real, personal, and engaging.</p>
<p><em>The Double</em> was an impulse buy from the bookstore on Stanford&rsquo;s campus. I was looking for a copy of <em>The Idiot</em> or <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em>, but <em>The Double</em> caught my eye instead. The description on the back piqued my interest even further. I bought the book, thinking that I was in for an enjoyable and thought-provoking read.</p>
<p>Boy, was I wrong. <em>The Double</em> was nothing like <em>Crime</em> or <em>Notes</em>. In my opinion, this is one of Dostoevsky&rsquo;s weaker works and was not very enjoyable to read. I found the plot drawn out and repetitive, and the prose difficult to read. I would normally attribute the latter gripe to the translator, but I have read elswhere that the original Russian text of the book was just as complicated.</p>
<p>The dialogue and psychological exploration was still outstanding, marking the novel as distinctly Dostoevskian. Similar to his other novels, it features an blood-curdling ability to force you into the protagonist&rsquo;s head. I felt like I was inside his thoughts, following him hand-in-hand in his psychological descent.</p>
<p>However, this forte was held back by a plot I could not fully understand. It closely followed the protagonist&rsquo;s actions, but when your protagonist is an anxious schizophrenic, the story becomes incredibly confusing.</p>
<p>In the end, I agree with Dostoevsky&rsquo;s own opinion of the work. He stated in <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Writer%27s_Diary">A Writer&rsquo;s Diary</a></em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most decidedly, I did not succeed with that novel; however, its idea was rather lucid, and I have never expressed in my writings anything more serious. Still, as far as form was concerned, I failed utterly.</p>

      <title>Why is Reading Gendered?</title>
      <link>https://hayaan.me/posts/0002/</link>

      <description>Where did all the fiction-loving men go?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I read a lot. Now that I think about it, I probably read too much. I stay up for hours most nights engrossed in the expansive world behind my Kindle&rsquo;s screen, dying to learn about the latest adventure the protagonist has gotten caught up in.</p>
<p>When introducing myself to someone new, I usually say that I read books as a hobby. Recently, a girl I was talking to asked me my favorite book. &ldquo;<em>Crime and Punishment</em>,&rdquo; I responded. She replied, &ldquo;Dostoevsky, right?&rdquo; I can&rsquo;t convey on paper how much joy I felt in that moment.</p>
<p>I realized that my life was missing someone I could really talk to about what I&rsquo;m reading. Unfortunately, I&rsquo;m the only male I know who loves fiction in this way. Some of my friends will gladly read the latest self-help book or thousand-page physics tome, but none of them can get lost in the pages of a good novel.</p>
<p>I wish I had a friend group with whom I could discuss the literature I find myself consumed by. Some people to talk to about the things on my mind. I believe that many men are in a similar situation to myself.</p>
<p>So my question is, when did reading fiction become a woman&rsquo;s thing to do? The statistics are clear: Goodreads <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/blog/show/475-sex-and-reading-a-look-at-who-s-reading-whom">reported</a> in 2014 that women read two times more books published that year than their male counterparts.</p>
<p>What is the cause? According to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-422X(00)00003-6">a study</a> published in 2000, girls are more likely to be encouraged by their parents to read at a young age and usually have more free-time to do so later in life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a shame that a hobby like reading, widely considered to provide social, intellectual, and personal benefits, must be a gendered activity. To all the parents out there, encourage your sons to read!</p>

      <description>Why I write.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fitting for the first post on this blog to be an explanation of why I&rsquo;m writing.</p>
<p>One of my friends recently began posting more of his thoughts on social media because he felt that writing had taken a backseat in his life. He wanted to rekindle that quickly fading love for the pen. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the case with me.</p>
<p>Neither do I want to attract followers or make money. If I wanted to do that, I would be posting AI-generated content somewhere with more eyes, like Medium.</p>
<p>I discovered a quote that I think sums up my thoughts nicely. Amit G. <a href="https://amitg.blog/my-daughter-was-writing-in-her-journal-today-and-casually-asked-me-why-she-does">writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My daughter went on to scribble happily in her journal. Once she was done, she said, “I love how I feel when I capture everything on my mind in these pages.”</p>
<p>Even I want that now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I want to write because there is something trapped inside of me angry that I won&rsquo;t let it out. There are way to many thoughts in my head, fighting to be put down on paper. I want this blog to be a place where I can let the little <a href="https://allpoetry.com/poem/8509539-Bluebird-by-Charles-Bukowski">bluebird</a> in my soul roam free, at least for a little while.</p>
<h2 id="future-plans">Future Plans</h2>
<p>This blog will have absolutely no AI-generated content. It will have no advertisements, tracking, or harvesting of data. It will be raw and free: a place where I can write down my thoughts for the world to see.</p>
<p>I recently came across <a href="https://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/">Julia Cameron&rsquo;s Morning Pages</a>, where you write three pages from the heart stream-of-conciousness style every morning. That&rsquo;s a little too hardcore for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m aiming for posting about 300 words every day on this blog. Some days I&rsquo;ll write more, some days less. It&rsquo;s all about building a habit. Let&rsquo;s see how it goes.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I have enabled completely anonymized tracking. Nothing personally identifiable, even your IP address, is collected.</p>
