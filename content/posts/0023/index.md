I have slowly been removing more and more Google products from my life over concerns about their privacy, or lack thereof. I switched to DuckDuckGo, left Chrome for Firefox, and so on. So, like the inconsistent wreck I am, I have gotten my hands on a Google Nest Hub that I promptly set up on my bedside table.

Like any Google product, its filled with blatant grabs for my data in the name of improving the company's products and services. I have said no to everything I can, but still I'm uneasy about keeping it. It's a substantial upgrade over my previous alarm clock, given that it can set multiple alarms (the main feature I need) and also has all the Google Assistant stuff. However, there is something that erks me about keeping a motion sensor and microphone pointed at me all night, especially when all that data is going straight to Google's servers.

I would feel much better about this if the data stayed on my device. But Google sends so many data points to their servers that really doesn't need to be there. One can't even ask Google Assistant for the time without being connected to the internet.

In the end, I'm on the fence about keeping it. Don't get me wrong, it's an amazing product, but I am bothered by having a smart display run by Google, of all companies.
