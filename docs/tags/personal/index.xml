      <title>Cities Upon a Hill</title>

      <description>Social media is dying.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&rsquo;t have any social media. I never have. But every day I am swarmed with signals from the top platforms on the web to JOIN JOIN JOIN! And when the signals aren&rsquo;t directly from them, they are from friends and family, who subtly give me funny looks when I tell them that I don&rsquo;t have an Instagram.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I nearly made a Mastodon account. <em>Nearly.</em> While Mastodon is great as far as social media platforms go, it is still fundamentaly a breed of app I don&rsquo;t want anything to do with.</p>
<p>Manuel Moreale <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/places-on-the-web">wrote</a> yesterday:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Big social media platforms are the metropolis: dense, busy, chaotic. They’re the place that never sleeps and there’s always something new going on.<br>
&hellip;<br>
There was a time when forums were the cities of the web but now are more like small towns. They’re the place where people congregate around shared interests.<br>
&hellip;<br>
And then there’re personal sites, the house in the forest. It’s the place people escape to when they’re tired of the noise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Big social media platforms have gone from cities upon a hill to something that resembles today&rsquo;s San Francisco: dirty, crime-ridden, and dying. I think I&rsquo;ll stick to my house in the forest, even if nobody is here with me.</p>

      <title>School Has Started</title>

      <description>The beginning of the end.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My senior year of high school started on Monday. I am expecting a brutal few months, filled with countlessly revising long college essays in the hopes of gaining admission somewhere I won&rsquo;t totally hate.</p>
<p>It is not all bad, though. I really only have three difficult classes: Honors English, AP Psychology, and AP Macroeconomics. I may decide to self-study AP Literature, but I don&rsquo;t know yet.</p>
<p>The school is also giving us Tuesdays and Thursdays off, and Fridays are half-days, so every week is more-or-less an easy week. And there is a big international trip in December I am looking forward to.</p>
<p>As to how this development relates to the blog, I&rsquo;m not sure. I may not write as much if I am overburdened with work during the school year. Or, I may write a lot now that I have another source of stimuli and reflection in my life. Who knows?</p>

      <title>On Sleep</title>

      <description>I really need more of it...</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>It is He who made the night a garment for you, and sleep a rest, and made the day like a resurrection. (Quran 25:47)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>School has started up again this week. On the second day of English class, the teacher showed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MuIMqhT8DM">this Ted Talk</a> about sleep to us. The video discussed the numerous consequenses of not getting a good night&rsquo;s sleep. The ones that stood out most to me were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lowered intelligence by 40%</li>
<li>Inability to commit events to long-term memory</li>
<li>Increase in rates of car accidents and heart attacks</li>
<li>Promotion of cancer and harm to the immune system</li>
</ul>
<p>I really need to start focusing on my sleep. My nighttime routine involves washing up, praying, and reading a book before slowly drifting to sleep. Some nights, I don&rsquo;t fall asleep until 1am. I will just lie there with my eyes open for an hour and half, blink, and wake up five hours later.</p>
<p>The most simple improvement is just going to bed earlier. Reading action-packed novels can keep my mind awake long after I put the book down, so avoiding these types of books when I am winding down is also key.</p>
<p>Here is the video. I encourage everyone to watch it.</p>
