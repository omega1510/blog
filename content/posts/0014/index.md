I am starting to apply to colleges, and beginning that process involves first choosing what major to study. I love biology and chemistry, so I am naturally inclined to choose biochemistry. However, there are a number of issues that prevent me from pursuing what I would love to do in the future.

First, if I am to major in biochemistry, I am more-or-less forced to pursue a doctoral degree. To quit my education with just a Bachelor's would be to condemn myself to a poor job outlook. Most companies in biotech are looking for candidates with a Ph.D. or M.D., and jobs for recent graduates with just a Bachelor's are few and far between, often with disappointing salaries.

Second, I do not want to be a physician, and there aren't many options for lucrative careers in biology that do not involve practicing medicine. I would love to research and teach, not work with patients. The classic path for doing research is a Ph.D., but putting in nearly a decade of work to make less than what a doctor does doesn't sound appealing to me.

The only upside to doing a Ph.D. that I can see is the lower cost. People regularly leave medical school with half a million dollars in student debt. In contrast, doctoral students usually get a stipend from the lab they work at which mostly covers the cost of the program, and they can teach a little bit to make up the difference in cash.

I would love to do a Ph.D. and have great job prospects afterwards that are not limited to academia. It would be great to do research in a lab somewhere and live a life where I am doing what I love. Unfortunatly, in the current education landscape, that does not seem to be possible. For now, I plan to apply as a biochemistry major and complete my undergraduate degree. Then I will see what the future holds.
