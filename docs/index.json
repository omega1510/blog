[{"content":" And now I know not what virtue is, and you seem to be in the same case, although you did once perhaps know.\n Thus spoke Socrates in Plato\u0026rsquo;s Meno. In my opinon, one of the great tradegies of the modern era is that so many of us have lost our way. We all fall short, in one way or another, in our life-long pursuit of virtue.\nThe problem has its foundation in the definition of virtue. For those of us that believe in a soul, Socrates among them, the definition is relatively easy to achieve. Our souls were in contact before our births with the True, the Good, and the Beautiful; defining virtue is simply remembering what we have once forgotten, hence Socrates' statement above.\nBut for those who deny the existence of the soul, or, in fact, any greater reality above the human experience, this approach is unapplicable. For someone like Kant, who argues that we cannot know the world as it is, we must define virtue subjectively, within the frameworks through which we experience reality.\nA possible solution involves inductive reasoning, where you derive a general rule from the observation of many smaller incidents. Perhaps it is possible to define virtue by observing virtuous actions, and attempt to discover a general rule therein. However, while this form of reasoning is ubiquitous in scientific research, it does not apply here.\nPlato addresses this approach early in his dialogue, Meno:\n Socrates:\n…By the gods, Meno, be generous, and tell me what you say that virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find that I have been mistaken, and that you… do really have this knowledge; although I have been just saying that I have never found anybody who had.\nMeno:\nThere will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering your question. Let us take first the virtue of a man—he should know how to administer the state, and in the administration of it to benefit his friends and harm his enemies; and he must also be careful not to suffer harm himself. A woman\u0026rsquo;s virtue, if you wish to know about that, may also be easily described: her duty is to order her house, and keep what is indoors, and obey her husband. Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of each of us in all that we do. And the same may be said of vice, Socrates.\n Ahh, the classic argument for subjective morality. Socrates makes no delay in swiftly pointing out its flaws, however:\n Socrates:\nWhen you say, Meno, that there is one virtue of a man, another of a woman, another of a child, and so on, does this apply only to virtue, or would you say the same of health, and size, and strength? Or is the nature of health always the same, whether in man or woman?\nMeno:\nI should say that health is the same, both in man and woman.\nSocrates:\nAnd is not this true of size and strength? If a woman is strong, she will be strong by reason of the same form and of the same strength subsisting in her which there is in the man. I mean to say that strength, as strength, whether of man or woman, is the same. Is there any difference?\nMeno:\nI think not.\nSocrates:\nAnd will not virtue, as virtue, be the same, whether in a child or in a grown-up person, in a woman or in a man?\n In other words, Socrates agrees that leading a state or maintaining a household are virtuous actions, but simply stating that they are does not constitute a definition of virtue. Instead, these actions all share a certain characteristic—that of true virtue—among other characteristics that differentiate them. To identify virtue by looking at virtuous actions, Socrates argues, we must identify a characteristic common to all virtuous actions, and not just give examples of the latter.\nIt is in this endeavor that difficulty lies. It is akin to me giving you an apple, an orange, and a peach, and asking you to give me an objective definition of what a fruit is. Incredibly difficult, if not impossible. Similarly, in ethics, it is incredibly difficult to derive a definition of virtue by considering virtuous actions.\nA \u0026ldquo;bottom-up\u0026rdquo; approach is not effective in the pursuit of virtue. While it does seem like a good idea, inductive reasoning falls short in practice. A \u0026ldquo;top-down\u0026rdquo; perspective is much simpler, and as Occam\u0026rsquo;s Razor tells us, is much more likely to be correct.\n","permalink":"https://hayaan.me/posts/0033/","summary":"And now I know not what virtue is, and you seem to be in the same case, although you did once perhaps know.\n Thus spoke Socrates in Plato\u0026rsquo;s Meno.

Email is best used for conversations between two or more people who share a personal connection.

Its forcing its way into a service because it\u0026rsquo;s popular, not because it\u0026rsquo;s the right choice.\nWhat if you could separate newsletters into a different app? Instead of email, newsletters should use RSS, which is designed to be one-way. This is better for the user, who can deal with newsletters together with all their other news. It\u0026rsquo;s better for the newsletter, which no longer has to implement hacky workarounds to avoid bugs in email.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s also the reason that this blog doesn\u0026rsquo;t offer a newsletter, only RSS.

Even if he admits it, he admits it as a fact of nature till then unrecognized by him. Faith does not, in the realist, spring from the miracle but the miracle from faith. If the realist once believes, then he is bound by his very realism to admit the miraculous also. The Apostle Thomas said that he would not believe till he saw, but when he did see he said, \u0026ldquo;My Lord and my God!\u0026rdquo; Was it the miracle forced him to believe?

I admit, I have only ever finished a handful of philosophical books, choosing instead to read excerpts and essays. In this limited fashion, I have read Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, Kant, Sartre, and so on.\nIn my opinion, excerpts are an easy way to get into philosophy. They take what can sometimes be a 1000+ page tome, and give you a taste of a main argument for an idea.

It was published in 2006, and I feel that it was a breath of fresh air given that I mostly read 19th-century Russian novels.\nThe book describes the journey of a father and son in a post-apocalyptic landscape decimated by an unspecified cataclysm. There are many themes in the book, but I would like to focus on reason vs. emotion in this post.\nThe father is far from optimistic. Numerous times throughout the plot, the son asks his father if there are other good people still alive somewhere, like Mars. The father makes no delay in shutting this optimism down, saying that it\u0026rsquo;s impossible for humans to survive on other planets.\nInstead, he is focused on survival in a completely rational way. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t let emotion cloud his judgement. The boy falters in fear when entering an abandoned house, but the father goes in knowing they must find food or die.\nHowever, the end reveals that it is a mix of rationality and emotion that helps you achieve salvation. The boy\u0026rsquo;s life is saved after the father\u0026rsquo;s death only because he emotionally trusted a random stranger. Similarly, the father and son have only survived this long because the father put logic first.\nThis shows that it is important to strike a balance in our life.

No algorithms serving me content to control me and maximize my watch time. I have full control.\nOne thing I find particularly dangerous with algorithms is news websites. They try to serve you headlines that incite an emotional response, not ones that give you an actual overview of the news. This way, they can have a massive influence on what the public believes. It is a modern-day version of the content censorship that was widespread in totalitarian governments, like the Soviet Union.

It\u0026rsquo;s author, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, was imprisoned in the Soviet Union\u0026rsquo;s harsh Gulag work camp system under Stalin from 1945 to 1953. After his release, Solzhenitsyn began writing One Day, a narrative of life in the Gulag. The book helped spark a wave of anti-Soviet sentiment after its publication.\nI am almost struggling to give a consice overview of the Gulag\u0026rsquo;s psychological horror outlined in this novel. It is so dense and multifaceted that no short post like this can do it justice. Whenever you think that Solzhenitsyn has covered all the atrocities of the labor camps, the book hits you with another way the Gulag tries to break its prisoners. Does the horror stop at physical work? No, there are no fixed wages and another person screwing up means no one gets any money. Does it stop there? No, corruption in the Gulag\u0026rsquo;s administration means you can\u0026rsquo;t file complaints either. Does it stop there? Absolutely not.\nI am so upset that people were abused to the point that they must lick other people\u0026rsquo;s bowls of soup clean to get enough nutrition. And camps like this aren\u0026rsquo;t a relic of the past; they still exist in places like China and Burma.\nThe novel is still very much applicable to us in the current era.

In the same book where his arguments were published, the Summa Theologica, the Catholic philosopher addressed a possible objection to the omnipotence of God.\nHe begins by describing the objection:\n It seems that God does not exist; because if one of two contraries be infinite, the other would be altogether destroyed. But the word \u0026ldquo;God\u0026rdquo; means that He is infinite goodness. If, therefore, God existed, there would be no evil discoverable; but there is evil in the world. Therefore God does not exist.\n What does Aquinas mean by this? He first states a premise that two infinite things—good and evil in the passage—cannot both exist together. If either one is infinite, then it must overpower the other. For example, a world with an infinite source of good cannot contain any evil. Furthermore, if God exists, then He must be infinitely good, and His goodness must overpower all evil in the universe. However, there is clearly evil present in the world we live in. Therefore God, or at least an omnipotent one, cannot exist our universe.\nOn the surface, this objection seems convincing. It strikes an emotional chord with most people, who have been through calamities in their lives and often questioned the supremacy of God thereafter. The objection is a variation of the classic question: \u0026ldquo;why do bad things happen to good people?\u0026rdquo;\nAquinas addresses this remonstration by citing Augustine of Hippo, a bishop who defended Christianity against philosophical attacks in his writings. Augustine argues that God\u0026rsquo;s power is so great that He would not allow evil to exist unless he could bring good out of evil; therefore, even a universe with evil in it can contain an infinitely good God because all evil actions have the potential for good.\nAs Aquinas puts it:\n This is part of the infinite goodness [and mercy] of God, that He should allow evil to exist, and out of it produce good.\n ","permalink":"https://hayaan.me/posts/0017/","summary":"This post is an addendum to yesterday\u0026rsquo;s post about Thomas Aquinas\u0026rsquo;s five ways to argue for the existence of God.

Even Socrates called into question the supremacy of the ancient Greek gods in his home of Athens nearly half a millenium prior to the birth of Christ. Still today, theists are engaged in vigorous debate with modern philosophers over rational evidence for God\u0026rsquo;s existence.\nIn the mid-13th century, Catholic philosopher Thomas Aquinas composed his magnum opus, the Summa Theologica, a religious textbook for students beginning their studies in theology. He recognized the necessity of proving God\u0026rsquo;s existence in his work, and wrote the Quinque Viae: five ways to argue that God does indeed exist.\nAquinas' arguments are admittedly weak when exposed to modern scrutiny, but they provide a basis for many modern arguments favoring God. They are heavily cited, \u0026ldquo;classic\u0026rdquo; theological arguments, not necessarily fool-proof ones. Nevertheless, they create an excellent baseline on which to form a complete understanding of God\u0026rsquo;s existence.\nThe Argument of the Unmoved Mover In the world we live in, everything is in motion. But for something to be in motion, it must have been moved by something else. For example, if I push a block of wood, a chemical imbalance in my muscles acted a force on the block. The chemical imbalance also itself was caused by electrical impulses in my nerves, which in turn were caused by something else.\nThis chain cannot be infinitely long; it therefore follows that there must have been a first mover in the beginning who, while unmoved, exerted a force on the universe. This primeval entity is understood to be God.\nThe Argument of the First Cause We live in a world of cause and effect. Things are caused by other things. It is not possible for a thing to cause itself, so it must have been caused by another distinct event. This second event is itself the effect of another cause, and so on. For example, a plant grows because of sunlight, which exists because of the sun, which exists because of gravity.\nLike in the first argument, this chain cannot continue ad infinitum. A first cause must exist that began the chain but was not caused itself. This cause is God.\nThe Argument from Contingency Things can be broadly divided into two groups: the possible and the necessary. Possible things are those that have the ability to not exist. For example, cats are possible entities because they live and die, and if you go back far enough in time, no cats existed.\nFor every possible thing, there is a time in the past when it did not exist. If everything is possible, then there must exist a time long in the past when nothing existed at all. If this is the case, then nothing could exist now, because nothing can come into existence except through a being that already exists.\nTherefore, it follows that a necessary being—something that must exist and cannot be nonexistent—existed in the beginning. Everything that exists draws its existence back to it. This necessary being is God.\nThe Argument from Degree All things vary in their imitation of the True, the Good, and the Beautiful. Some entities imitate at a higher degree, and are subsequently considered better. For example, in a room of people, there is always a tallest.\nSomething must exist that is the most True, Good, and Beautiful—the \u0026ldquo;tallest\u0026rdquo; of all existence, so to speak. Furthermore, the most perfect in any group is the cause of all qualities of that group, like how fire, the pinnacle of heat, is the cause of all hot things. There must be a being to which all truth, nobility, and beauty is devoted—a being perfect in every way. This being we call God.\nThe Argument from Final Cause Inanimate objects in the world behave in regular and predictable ways. If their design was based purely on chance, then their behavior would not be predictable. For these inanimate objects, which lack intelligence, the fact that they move toward the same purpose means they must have been directed by something else with intelligence and influence.\nTherefore, a being must exist that is the source of all common purpose in the governance of the world. God is this being.\nDiscussion I find myself agreeing with much of what Aquinas has to say. His simple language and illustrative examples helped me refine the thoughts floating around my head. I am sure we have all heard the Argument of the Unmoved Mover and Argument from Final Cause before, but to read it from the source is an enlightening experience.\nModern philosophy has not failed to uncover fallacies in Aquinas' arguments; in addition, his writings leave a distinctly Platonic/Aristotelian aftertaste in my mouth. But there is something endearing about Aquinas' attempt at distilling things I have heard for years into concrete philosophical statements. There is undoubtedly a reason why Aquinas is so commonly referenced in philosophy courses: he took a concept as perfect as God and made it comprehensible by the imperfect human cognition.\n","permalink":"https://hayaan.me/posts/0016/","summary":"The existence of God has been a point of contention among philosophers for as long as philosophy has existed.

Recently, I also switched my old desktop over to the lightweight operating system. When people argue over what system is the best, they often only consider macOS or Windows. However, a user of either system will not consider where both fail because they have never experienced what they could have had. Because I use neither, I think I can provide a unique perspective on the shortcomings of both options.\nI first had the idea to write about this when I replaced the Gnome desktop environment that came default with Pop_OS! with another piece of software called i3. It was a much better experience, and I wondered why other people do not make similar modifications to their computers. I soon realized, however, that modifications like this are not even possible when you are using a more conventional operating system.\nHistorically, operating systems did what they said on the can: operate the system. They allowed applications, which were defined by the user, to communicate with the computer\u0026rsquo;s hardware, and vice-versa.\nBut now, operating systems have gone from being a simple interface between applications and hardware to all-powerful processes demanding the user\u0026rsquo;s complete submission. Gone are the days of choosing what your computer runs; operating systems provide default apps, and you must use them.\nMany points of contention in the \u0026ldquo;what OS is best\u0026rdquo; debate arise from the operating system making decisions for you and not letting you change its choice. For example, people argue over the placement of buttons on either the top-left or top-right corner. macOS has gone with the former option, while Windows chooses the latter. But this decision should never have been the OS\u0026rsquo;s to make! This decision has always been made by the user when they installed a desktop environment; who let Apple or Microsoft choose?\nTo illustrate again: Microsoft recently rounded the corners of windows in a visual revamp of their operating system. Historically, this has been an option in applications called compositors, which the user could choose to install. If they weren\u0026rsquo;t satisfied with one, they could choose another. By rounding corners of windows with no way to undo it, Microsoft made a decision that the user had the right to make.\nI suppose that Apple and Microsoft are doing this in the name of \u0026ldquo;crafting an experience.\u0026rdquo; I have nothing against that. In fact, I applaud them for taking the time to create great applications, like desktop environments, window managers, and compositors, and including them with their operating systems. I take issue with the fact that they have stolen the user\u0026rsquo;s ability to switch to another application they find better.\nBoth tech giants already include apps that fit this philosophy. Apple provides Disk Utility on their computers, a great app to format and manage storage drives on your computer. They also don\u0026rsquo;t force you to use it, letting you install other drive-managing software. If they took this stance with other parts of their operating systems, it would be better for everyone. Regular users would get their default apps and experience, while advanced ones could install they apps they want installed.\nIn the meantime, I\u0026rsquo;ll stick with Linux, where I can choose exactly what code my CPU is crunching through.\n","permalink":"https://hayaan.me/posts/0008/","summary":"I have been using Pop_OS!, a popular Linux distribution, on my laptop for years.

If someone had cash to burn and wanted to grow it, they would invest in something much more lucrative. We buy watches because we like them; it is a deeply emotional purchase.

In an increasingly scientific world, some of them argue that our choices are determined only by the laws of physics. In contrast, others believe that free will is an essential component of human nature. Although the universe appears to operate in a deterministic way, the idea of free will is instrumental in our moral accountability and individual identity.\nOne thing that separates us as humans from animals is that we take responsibility for our actions. An animal acts purely based on its desires; a lion cannot be held accountable for killing a gazelle. On the other hand, humans can be punished for their unjust acts. This innate responsibility and accountability follows from the belief that humans have free will, that we choose to transgress. We must be responsible for our actions if there were alternate actions we could have taken. In a debate with English philosopher Thomas Hobbes, Dr. John Bramhall argued exactly this. He stated: “No man blames fire for burning whole cities; no man taxes poison for destroying men; but [he only blames] those persons who apply them to such wicked ends. If the will of man be not in his own disposition, he is no more a free agent than the fire or the poison.” Our world is built on the punishment of immoral actions. In many cases, a man only acts good because he is required to do so. If there was no free will, he could not be held accountable for his actions and all punishments would be baseless.\nIn addition to moral accountability, the idea of free will is also essential in our sense of personal identity. In his book Being and Nothingness, French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre suggests that our choices define who we are, and that without the ability to make choices, we would be nothing more than objects in the world. Sartre believes that humans have the ability to transcend their circumstances, “project forward”, and make choices that create their own identities. He argues that when we make a moral decision, we are not just choosing between different options—we are also choosing what kind of person we want to be. For example, when we choose to tell the truth instead of lying, we are not just choosing the \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; action—we are also choosing to be a truthful person. Free will is necessary for this development of identity. A purely deterministic system would take this away.\nBreakthroughs in science suggest that the universe is deterministic. Everything exists in the movement of invisible atoms. Our consciousness is just neurons firing inside our skulls. How can one be free to will in this situation? While it is true that the universe appears to operate in a deterministic way, this does not necessarily mean that free will is an illusion. St. Augustine of Hippo targets this idea in his book The City of God. In his writing, he takes the determinist universe to be like God, who “knows unchangeably all things which shall be.” Augustine argues that, even though there is a God who knows everything, we still have the ability to make and act on our choices. This is because our wills work in conjunction with the will of God to predetermine things. God\u0026rsquo;s foreknowledge of future events is based on his infinite wisdom and understanding of human nature, rather than on any causal relationship between God\u0026rsquo;s knowledge and human actions. Therefore, even if the universe operates deterministically, it is still possible that humans have free will because our wills are part of the determining process.\nThe debate about free will has been ongoing for centuries, with some philosophers arguing that our choices are determined by the laws of physics and others arguing that free will is an essential component of human nature. While breakthroughs in science suggest that the universe is deterministic, the idea of free will remains instrumental in our moral accountability and personal identity. Without free will, we would not be able to take responsibility for our actions, nor would we be able to define ourselves as individuals. Even the deterministic universe suggested by science remains compatible with free will. When considering all these factors, it becomes clear that humans, as Sartre puts it, are “condemned to be free.”\n","permalink":"https://hayaan.me/posts/0006/","summary":"This essay was submitted in partial fulfillment of an Intro to Philosophy course at Foothill College.\nFor centuries, philosophers have debated what free will is and whether we even possess it.

It has stuck with me all these years because, as far as I can tell, it was my first introduction to the world of philosophy. When the teacher asked it to that group of young third-graders, no one could answer him. Now, I think I might have a response.\nWhat is an Evil Action?  An evil intention perverts the best actions, and makes them sins.\n— Joseph Addison\n To clear up any ambiguity, we need to determine what exactly makes an action evil. We may define it very broadly, such that an evil action is one where there is even a small amount of immorality present, regardless of the greater good. This would include the classical \u0026ldquo;bad\u0026rdquo; actions, like murder and lying, as well as immoral acts performed for a large benefit, as in the case of the trolley problem. Nearly every action we perform could be considered evil under this definition. An action performed solely for our benefit could be considered selfish, and therefore evil, for example.\nInstead, one may limit the broad definition of evil, stating that an evil action is any action where the bad in it outweighs the good. This definition necessarily encompasses all immoral acts while omitting ones performed for the greater good.\nA second alternative is a strict definition, where an action must be completely morally wrong, without any shred of good, for it to be considered evil. With this view, we omit many actions that are technically wrong but that nobody would call \u0026ldquo;evil,\u0026rdquo; such as white lies, for even a white lie would be beneficial to someone. However, we also exclude nearly every immoral act because most of them contain at least a little good; they are, so to speak, for the lesser good, but still good nonetheless.\nI find the second definition—the limited yet broad one—to be the most appealing. It leaves wiggle room for actions performed for the greater good but includes things we would normally consider evil, like homicide.\nWhat is an Evil Person?  To prefer evil to good is not in human nature; and when a man is compelled to choose one of two evils, no one will choose the greater when he might have the less.\n— Plato\n An evil person could be someone who simply performs bad actions, no matter how little. If we accept this definition, in combination with either broad definition of evil, to be evil is to be human because men are not angels: we always incline towards a little bit of sin as consequence of our free will.1\nIf we consider an evil person as someone who performs only evil and no good, we get nowhere. Even Hitler, who we can all agree is evil, still paid his officers' wages. He did not wake up every morning with just the intention to kill. If we take this approach, no one in the history of mankind has been evil.\nIn my opinion, the best definition of an evil person, as with the case of evil actions, is someone who performs more evil than they do good. With this definition and the medium definition of evil, all the classical \u0026ldquo;evil\u0026rdquo; figures—Stalin, Hitler, Mao—would all be considered evil.\nThe answer to the question \u0026ldquo;Do evil people exist?\u0026rdquo; depends on your definition of \u0026ldquo;evil\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;evil person.\u0026rdquo; It can be argued that everybody is evil, or nobody is evil, or that only a few bad figures are evil. It is a matter of nuance and personal preference, and there is no right answer.\n  Even if you don\u0026rsquo;t believe in free will, I think you can agree that no one acts morally all of the time, regardless of whether they are responsible for their actions.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","permalink":"https://hayaan.me/posts/0005/","summary":"This question was first asked to me nearly a decade ago by an elementary school teacher.

It is the third of Dostoevsky\u0026rsquo;s works that I have read. I am usually a huge fan of the author; my favorite book is Crime and Punishment and I also loved Notes from the Underground. I love the deep explorations of morality and psychology that are woven throughout his books. His dialogue is unlike anything else that I have read: it is so real, personal, and engaging.\nThe Double was an impulse buy from the bookstore on Stanford\u0026rsquo;s campus. I was looking for a copy of The Idiot or The Brothers Karamazov, but The Double caught my eye instead. The description on the back piqued my interest even further. I bought the book, thinking that I was in for an enjoyable and thought-provoking read.\nBoy, was I wrong. The Double was nothing like Crime or Notes. In my opinion, this is one of Dostoevsky\u0026rsquo;s weaker works and was not very enjoyable to read. I found the plot drawn out and repetitive, and the prose difficult to read. I would normally attribute the latter gripe to the translator, but I have read elswhere that the original Russian text of the book was just as complicated.\nThe dialogue and psychological exploration was still outstanding, marking the novel as distinctly Dostoevskian. Similar to his other novels, it features an blood-curdling ability to force you into the protagonist\u0026rsquo;s head. I felt like I was inside his thoughts, following him hand-in-hand in his psychological descent.\nHowever, this forte was held back by a plot I could not fully understand. It closely followed the protagonist\u0026rsquo;s actions, but when your protagonist is an anxious schizophrenic, the story becomes incredibly confusing.\nIn the end, I agree with Dostoevsky\u0026rsquo;s own opinion of the work. He stated in A Writer\u0026rsquo;s Diary:\n Most decidedly, I did not succeed with that novel; however, its idea was rather lucid, and I have never expressed in my writings anything more serious.
