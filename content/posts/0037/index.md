M. Hadi writes about me in "[Writing for an audience vs. writing for the sake of writing](https://mhadi.blog/posts/writing-for-audience/)":

> Hayaan had started a blog without telling anyone. He wrote his posts without telling anyone. He didn’t even share any of his posts with me until he had one that was specific to a topic I was interested in, around 10 posts in.
> 
> I was shocked—usually I would share every single post I wrote with him and a few other friends. I just couldn’t understand why he would write without sharing it with others… who was he even writing for?

The post concludes by answering that question:

> Writing for the sake of writing.
> 
> What does that even mean? It means writing because you want to write. It means writing for absolutely nobody. It means not caring what anyone thinks about what or how you write.
> 
> There’s nothing wrong with writing for an audience, but that’s simply marketing. You’re marketing yourself to others, with the goal of attracting an audience.
> 
> But writing for the sake of writing is sharing your thoughts with the world not caring if even a single person out of nine billion reads your thoughts.

Well, I tried to express that idea in [the first post](../0001/) of this blog. M. Hadi wrote it way better than I could. Now, if someone asks why I write, I'll just point them to his post.
