I believe a communist theory will make a comeback, but not because it is a better way to structure society and the economy. Rather, there will be a resurgence of communist thought simply because it is an alternative to capitalism. Issues with capitalism are widespread and apparent: one only needs to look to developing countries that still feature low wages or socioeconomic mobility despite their capitalist economies, e.g. Nicaraguan peasants. Because of this, people struggling under capitalism will be looking for an alternative. We may see a new Marxist revolution because it is a very popular alternative whose revolutions have been, at least in the short-term, successful. But this is not because it is a better system.

This is not to say that communist theories in the future will follow Marx’s ideas to a T. I cannot imagine revolutions like Pol Pot’s in Cambodia, with all their brutality and forced abandonment of old culture, gaining enough support to overthrow governments in the present day. If a communist movement is to be successful, I think it must reign itself in and only “curb the worst abuses of capitalism,” as the Nicaraguan socialist party states. In my opinion, it is not only possible, but likely that a communist theory with that principle as its thesis will make a comeback.
