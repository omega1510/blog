Using a custom domain on your website is great for all the obvious reasons. It forms a brand identity, keeps your site memorable, and looks much better than `username.github.io`, for example.

But, it's important for another reason: longevity. No web server is forever. Your website **will** die some day in the future in an irrecoverable way. When that happens, you will be forced to transfer it to a new server. If you don't own your domain, all the links to your content that you have accumulated throughout the years will die with your old server. With a custom domain, maintaining hyperlinks in the event of a catastrophic faliure is as simple as editing a couple lines of text.

It is for this reason that I have finally purchased a custom domain for this blog: [https://hayaan.me/](https://hayaan.me/). I hope you will too for your site.

P.S. Domain records are _way_ more complicated and slow than they ought to be.
